<h3>
CHAPTER I
</h3>

<p>
The year 1810 was more commonly known,
at least in the Kentucky wilderness, as the
thirty-fourth year of the Independence of
the United States.  Backwoods folk are
simple folk, proud of what they and their
fathers have done.
</p>

<p>
Although split with vexatious questions
of Federal or Democrat, rent asunder by
argument over the Great Conspiracy of
Aaron Burr, and menaced always by the
gathered allied hordes of Tecumthe across
the Indiana border, the settlers in and
around Louisville forgot all these things in
the one supreme fact that this was the
thirty-fourth year of the United States.
</p>

<p>
Law had come into the country, to the
bitterness of many.  Land-titles and sorry
scoundrels had in combination ousted many
a less famous man than Colonel Daniel
Boone from his holdings.  Whisky and
lawless border-life, to say nothing of the
more lawless river-ways, had ruined more
than one good man both in morals and
reputation.  Some said the western country
had gone to the dogs; others said that the
dogs had all come to the western country.
Both sayings were true, in a sense.
</p>

<p>
So, then, in this thirty-fourth year of the
United States, an old man stood on the
Beargrass Creek Road, just out of Louisville,
and swore volubly.  A horseman had
spattered him with mud.  To his right was a
fringe of trees, to his left the mudhole, and
just beyond him was a bend in the road.
</p>

<p>
The old man was only five feet ten, but
was thewed like a giant.  As he wiped the
mud from his cheek and glared at the
returning horseman, he displayed a strong,
keen-eyed face which sat well above powerful
shoulders and barrel-like chest.
</p>

<p>
"Consarn the lawyers!" he cried angrily.
"If I had my way, I'd hang every cussed
lawyer in Kaintuck!  Hanging's too good
for 'em.  Consarn 'em, I'd&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The horseman had reined in at the bend
and was now back beside the old man.  He
was a large athletic man, dressed in fine
blue broadcloth, with pudding cravat and
ear-high coat collar.  He leaned over in his
saddle with a smile.
</p>

<p>
"Sir, your pardon!  The offence was
unintentional.  I take it that you have a grudge
against lawyers, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Huh!"  The other grunted angrily, yet
with none of the sputtering fury of old age.
His words seemed calculated, in fact.
"Huh!  Hain't lawyers robbed me right and left an'
driv me out o' Kaintuck?  You're like all
of 'em, consarn ye, slick and smooth!  I
ain't lived seventy-six year 'thout bein'
able to read a man's face.  Ye black-hearted
Wyandot, why didn't ye turn out o' the
way&mdash;huh?"
</p>

<p>
At these final words the horseman went
white to the lips.  He was handsome, dark
of hair and eye, with thin lips, virile
features, and powerful hands.  Despite the
careful attire and courtly air, however,
there was an indescribably cruel curve to
his thin lips and nostrils, an arrogance in
his bearing, which seemed rather out of
place in democratic Kentucky.
</p>

<p>
"Sir, I asked your pardon," he said in
a deep voice, twitching his riding-whip
against his boot.  "In deference to your age
I pass over your words&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Cuss yer impudence!" broke out the old
man hotly, a flame leaping out in his blue
eyes.  "You're one o' them Louisville
vultures, huh?  I kin tell.  Pass over my
words, do ye?  Well, ye git down out'n
that saddle an' I'll give ye somethin' better
to pass over.  Hump down, consarn ye&mdash;I'll
pay out one debt more on yer carcass
afore I go back to Missoury!"
</p>

<p>
The old man did not look his seventy-six
years.  The wrathful earnestness of his
bearing bespoke his entire willingness to
chastise the lawyer, while there was a
dangerous vitality in his high-browed face.
The other gazed down steadily, contempt
sitting in his proud dark eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I have no quarrel with you, sir," he
returned slowly.  "Yet if you would seek
redress through the courts, you may seek
me at Louisville, where I am well known.
My name, sir, is Charles Duval, and I
regret that my apology did not&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
His stately courtesy and slight trace of
contempt served only to infuriate the old
man the more.  With one swift forward
stride, he gripped the bridle of the
horse.
</p>

<p>
"Git down out'n that saddle," he broke
in.  "I aim to git a feel o' yer hide right
here an' now, consarn ye!  I don't want no
courts."
</p>

<p>
"Hands off, you fool!" whipped out
Duval, deadly pale.  He made as if to raise
his riding-crop, put paused and twisted in
the saddle at sound of a cheery voice from
the bend of the road just behind him.  It
was a vibrant joyous voice, and the lilt of
song rose clearly on the afternoon air.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Oh, I fit with Gen'ral Washington an' I'd like to fight some more,<br />
  An' I'm going to join with Gen'ral Clark when next we go to war!<br />
  I'll tote my Kaintuck rifle, and I'll raise the Kaintuck boys,<br />
  And we'll sculp the bloody Britishers&mdash;&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The singer jogged around the bend of
trees and came to an abrupt halt as he
sighted the two.  His horse was good, his
deerhide dress bad, his rifle brass-mounted,
and his head bare.  Glinting brown hair, a
brown, clean-shaven face of youth and
strong lines, and clear brown eyes formed a
symphony of woods-colouring.
</p>

<p>
"Well, well!"  His eyes twinkled slightly
as he surveyed the scene before him.  "Is
this a highway robbery, friends?  Strength
assailed by old age&mdash;what an allegory we
find here!  And why not make youth the
mediator, may I ask?"
</p>

<p>
His appearance seemed to quiet the rage
of the old man, who released the horse's
bridle and stepped back calmly.  The
newcomer met the steady look of Duval,
but the twinkle passed from the brown eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" he snapped suddenly.  "Are you
dumb, sir?  I believe you intended to strike
this old man with your whip?"
</p>

<p>
"Sir, you are at liberty to formulate
your own beliefs," returned Duval coldly.
"Kindly get out of my path at once."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, this is more like it!" exclaimed the
stranger quickly.  "And if I refuse?"
</p>

<p>
A tide of passion flooded over Duval's
swarthy face.  He pushed his horse toward
the new-comer, lifting his whip.  There was
a slight, almost negligent motion, and he
found himself staring into the mouth of the
long rifle which had reposed on the brown
man's saddle-bow.
</p>

<p>
"Well, try it," smiled the stranger, but
with a glint in his brown eyes as they rested
on Duval's furious face.  "I fancy my
powder is still a bit too good for wasting,
unless you force me.  If you wish to pass,
sir&mdash;take the mud."
</p>

<p>
For a moment Duval was choked by his
rage.  While plainly no coward, he was
checked both at sight of the ready
trigger-finger and the cold purpose in the brown
eyes.  The old man, watching keenly,
stooped and picked up his fallen cap of
coonskin.
</p>

<p>
"Devil take you," cried Duval hoarsely,
the intensity of his passion clenching all his
face into wild fury.  "Sir, I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Whatever he might have said was stopped
by a thud of hoofs.  Once more the bend in
the quiet Beargrass Creek Road was invaded
at a critical moment, and this time by a
girl who rode from the direction whence
Duval had come.  And as before, the arrival
broke off threatening hostilities.
</p>

<p>
She was a beautiful girl enough, with her
fresh firm face and clear grey eyes, and the
red-gold hair falling over her shoulders.
Her steed was bony and her gown was
homespun, but Duval swung his horse around
with a graceful bow and swept his hat to
his stirrup as she drew rein.
</p>

<p>
"May I ride back to town with you,
Madam Trigg?" he asked quietly, giving
no hint of the storm which a moment before
had convulsed him.  "It seems there are
strangers and odd characters about, and it
may well&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He was interrupted by a cry of surprise.
The girl slipped from her saddle as the old
man stepped forward, and with a swift hug
and a laugh of rippling delight she flung
her arms about his neck.
</p>

<p>
"You!" she cried.  "Why, where on earth
did you come from?"
</p>

<p>
"Come from town," said the old man
jerkily.  He stared into her excited eyes
with a flush of pleasure on his rugged old
face, and seemed lost to all around.  "Come
in with some beaver, Kitty.  Paid the ol'
debts, every last man, thank God!  Clean's
a whistle now.  Goin' out to Dick Taylor's,
comin' to see you-all, then goin' back
home.  Be in town to-morrow sure."
</p>

<p>
His abrupt awkward speech drew another
hug and a kiss from the girl, who then
turned to her horse and scrambled to the
saddle.
</p>

<p>
"Be sure you come, then!" she cried
merrily, and looked at Duval: "I thank
you for the courtesy, sir, and avail myself
of it right gladly&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She broke off at sight of the brown-eyed
stranger, who had not moved.  Duval
touched his spurs and brought his horse
beside hers.
</p>

<p>
"Out of the way," he commanded sharply.
"This lady wishes to pass."
</p>

<p>
The leather-clad stranger smiled a little.
</p>

<p>
"And so she shall, friend Duval," he
drawled easily.  "I told you once that you
might take the mud."
</p>

<p>
"Confound you, sir&mdash;would you dare shoot
me?" broke in Duval furiously.  "I dare
you to do it, sir!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's a dare easily settled!"
laughed the other, but his eyes remained
very steady.  Pressing his steed with his
knee, he moved aside and left the inner
edge of the road clear.  "The lady is not
hindered.  As for you, if you doubt either my
ability or my will, why not test the matter?"
</p>

<p>
Duval noted the crooked trigger-finger,
muttered an impatient word, then turned
and splashed through the muddy water.
The girl went on, still gazing at the stranger.
As he drew upon the dry road and waited,
Duval turned.
</p>

<p>
"Take care of yourself!" he cried, his
face livid.
</p>

<p>
"That is my business in life, thanks,"
returned the stranger, lightly, and so he
found himself alone with the old man.
Carefully uncocking his rifle, he swung
down from the saddle and gripped hands
with the other.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you seem to be in no great need
of help," he chuckled, surveying the huge
chest of the grey-haired man.  "What's the
matter, anyway?  Did you have a fuss with
his excellency?"
</p>

<p>
"Kind of that way," grinned the old
man, to whom speech now seemed to come
slowly.  "Muddied me, the cussed
law-shark!  All alike, consarn 'em."
</p>

<p>
"Well, now he's gone, can you tell me
where Colonel Dick Taylor lives?"
</p>

<p>
"Goin' there," grunted the other, jerking
a thumb over his shoulder.  His keen blue
eyes searched the younger face shrewdly.
"Young man, ye handled him right.  You're
a fine fellow.  How are ye named?"
</p>

<p>
"Norton, John Norton," smiled the
younger man.  "I'm a captain in the Seventh
Infantry, or was, and came up from New
Orleans after resigning.  So you're going to
the Taylors, eh?  Know young Zach?  Do
you live around here?"
</p>

<p>
"Uh-huh, I know him.  Used to live
here."  The old man's face darkened as he
glanced around.  "Them cussed lawyers
skun me out o' my land, consarn 'em!  Live
in Missoury now.  Lots o' game there.  Come
back here to pay my debts&mdash;no man can't
say I ain't honest.  Them moccasins ain't
Cherokee-made, are they?"
</p>

<p>
"What's your name?" asked Norton with
frank interest.  He clucked to his horse,
and the steed followed them as they trudged
along the road.  The other only glanced
down at the moccasins.
</p>

<p>
"Name's Boone," he grunted.  "Them
moccasins, now&mdash;they sartin look kind o'
like&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Boone?"  Norton stopped abruptly, a
puzzled wonder in his eyes.  "You're not
Colonel Boone, by any chance?  Colonel
Daniel Boone?"
</p>

<p>
"That's me.  About them mocc&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Well, by thunder!" Norton gasped,
then laughed aloud as he seized Boone's
hand in a hearty clasp and looked deep into
the keen blue eyes.  "Why, Colonel, I spent
two days looking you up in Missouri, over
on the Femme Osage!  Your wife said you had
gone east, either to Virginia or Tennessee.
I was mighty anxious to see you&mdash;in fact,
that's why I threw up my army commission."
</p>

<p>
"Huh!  To see me?" Boone looked at
him, then jerked his head.  "Well, come
along to Dick's.  Find the wife well, did
ye?  Now tell me 'bout where ye got them
moccasins&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
John Norton was lost in amazement at
the manner in which he had chanced on the
one man in the country he most desired to
meet.  Daniel Boone was not greatly
honoured in that day.  He had been out of
the public view for twenty years and was
not of the self-assertive type; his fame
seemed to be dying out with the older
generation of frontiersmen.  Driven into the
South-west, he still made long, lonely forays
through the South and East, hunting and
trapping and seeking the solitude he loved.
</p>

<p>
At Femme Osage, Norton had missed him
by a month.  Then the young ex-officer had
come on by flatboat to Fort Massac, and from
there overland to Louisville.  He said no
more of his journey than this, but Boone
looked at the delicate yet decisive profile,
the brown eyes which could twinkle like a
star or leap out hard and cold like a
sword&mdash;and nodded to himself.
</p>

<p>
"Ye knew Zach down to N'Orleens, mebbe?
He's in the Seventh, ain't he?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," nodded Norton.  "We were great
friends, till he came North with fever.
How is he?  All right?"
</p>

<p>
Boone chuckled.  "The cuss has got
married, Norton."
</p>

<p>
"What?  He has?"  Norton whistled, then
broke into a laugh.  "Someone here?"
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;him and me brung her over from
Maryland.  Got here a month ago.  We
located beaver on the way, so I went back
an' got enough pelt to pay up some ol'
debts here in Louisville&mdash;consarn them
lawyers!"
</p>

<p>
Norton was not altogether surprised at
Zach Taylor's marriage.  He had gained his
captaincy at the time Zach joined the
regiment in New Orleans as lieutenant.
Barely had the two men become friends
when young Taylor went home on sick-leave.
This had been two years before, and
the reason for his prolonged absence was
now evident.  Norton's business concerned
Colonel Richard Taylor, Zach's father, no
less than it did Boone, so he had come on
to Louisville after missing the old frontiersman
at Femme Osage.  Now, by a fortunate
chance, he had come upon Boone as well&mdash;a
good presage, he reflected.  He was like
to have need of all the friends he could
muster.
</p>

<p>
The two tramped along between the cottonwoods,
and in a few moments sighted the
clustering log and frame buildings of the
Taylor farm, six miles above the city itself.
Colonel Taylor, or "Colonel Dick" as he
was known along the frontier, had been
Collector of the Port of Louisville until
Louisiana ceased to be foreign territory, in
1804, but for the past six years had abstained
from politics altogether and devoted himself
to his farm.  With the exception of George
Rogers Clark, who lived across the river
from Louisville, he was the town's most
prominent citizen, however; an old friend
of President Madison, his influence at
Washington bore no little weight.
</p>

<p>
As the two men approached the farm,
negroes came running out, Boone was recognized
with a delighted shout, and from the
different buildings appeared the family
itself.  Colonel Taylor and his wife were
joined by Zach and his bride, and while
Norton's horse was led away he met with
an exuberant welcome from the hard-featured
kindly-eyed lieutenant, his own elder by
two years.
</p>

<p>
"Dad, this is Captain Norton," cried
Taylor, introducing his friend in mad delight.
"He's the man I've told you about so
much&mdash;the officer who cleared out those river
pirates by Nagatoches!  Margaret&mdash;Mother!
Upon my word, Jack, what the devil brought
you here?"
</p>

<p>
This final outburst of helpless amazement
evoked a general laugh, and Norton found
himself placed at his ease by the quiet
hospitality of old Colonel Dick.  Boone was
the guest of honour, however, and the old
frontiersman was at once accorded an easy
chair by the fireplace when the party gathered
inside to hear the news.
</p>

<p>
Of this Boone brought little enough,
beyond the fact he had cleared off his old
debts and was ready to start for Missouri
with a dollar in his pocket and a clear
mind.
</p>

<p>
"You just missed Kitty Grigg," said
Colonel Dick.  "She was out here to visit
Margaret, while I was trying to keep that
skunk Duval from ridin' home with
her&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ye didn't do it," chuckled Boone.  "We
met 'em&mdash;consarn them lawyers!"
</p>

<p>
He proceeded to give a brief account of
the meeting, which drew a roar of applause
from Zach and his father.  Norton, however,
was bent on more serious matters than
visiting, and waved aside the eager
questions which rained upon him.
</p>

<p>
"No, there's no news&mdash;General Harrison
is keeping things pretty quiet along the
border, and the last I heard there was no
immediate talk of a British war.  I believe
Zach's going to get a captaincy before long,
though.  I've resigned, and the older officers
won't transfer into the Seventh; they think
the regiment won't last long&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You've resigned?" broke in Zach blankly.
"Why&mdash;good Lord, Jack!  You ain't goin'
to take up farming?  Got married?"
</p>

<p>
"Neither one," laughed Norton easily.
"I have letters to you, Colonel Taylor, to
Governor Harrison, and to Colonel Boone
here&mdash;and I want help.  There's been a good
deal of piracy of late, as you may know,
and my business here is to get that mysterious
fellow, Blacknose&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
His words were drowned in a sudden
crash, as Boone knocked over one of the huge
andirons with his foot.  Zachary Taylor
darted to the door and slammed it with a
bang; Mrs. Taylor went white, and Colonel
Dick started abruptly.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Norton," he said quickly,
frowning, "your business here had best wait
until the morning, when we will go to town
with Colonel Boone and talk it over then.
Margaret, will you see that the guest-cab in
is made ready?  How did you make out with
your beaver, Daniel?"
</p>

<p>
And Norton fell into an amazed silence,
while old Boone told of his hunting trip,
Why had the mere name of a river-pirate
brought fear to such men as these, and
pallor to the faces of the two women?
</p>

<p>
"By thunder!" he exclaimed inwardly,
listening to the old frontiersman's jerky
sentences.  "I wonder if I've struck a bigger
thing than they dreamed of at New Orleans?"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II
</h3>

<p>
Upon attaining his majority three years
before, John Norton had gained a
commission through the influence of his uncle,
a merchant at New Orleans.  Yellow fever
had left him alone in the world six months
afterward, and he had looked forward to a
career in the army.  By a curious combination
of circumstances, however, he had now
resigned that career to enter on a more
hazardous and difficult task.
</p>

<p>
What he remembered of his life had been
centred about New Orleans, but beyond a
casual acquaintance with his uncle's business
he had not lingered about the city save for
a few weeks at a time.  A few years of
wandering in the Southern woods with friendly
Indians, traders, and frontiersmen had given
him a thorough mastery of woodcraft; with
this his brief military career had not
interfered, for he had conducted several
treaty-making or mapping expeditions through
eastern Louisiana, once as far as Florida.
</p>

<p>
Now, however, a new service had offered
itself to him.  The Ohio Valley trade came
largely to St. Louis and New Orleans, by
means of arks and flatboats.  It was easy
to float down with the current, and men
took down their wares, sold them, and came
back overland, for the return river journey
was difficult.  A few years before, banditti
had been numerous until the Kentucky
riflemen had broken up the Harpe and Mason
gang of pirates.  Since that time there had
arisen a new king of the lawless, whose doings
had all but paralyzed the river trade.
</p>

<p>
"Let me give you my own story first,
gentlemen," said Norton quietly, as he rode
between Colonel Dick and Boone, with
Zach just ahead.  "Since you seem to jump
at the very name of Blacknose, things must
indeed be in a poor state up here."
</p>

<p>
The others merely nodded.  All four were
riding slowly toward Louisville; the sun
was but recently up, and in the brisk morning
air all thought of danger or trouble seemed
very vague and distant.  Yet Boone's keen
gaze never left the roadside.
</p>

<p>
"As you will, sir," responded Colonel
Dick courteously.  "My son has told us of
you, and we would be only too glad to hear
of your family.  I knew a gallant gentleman
of your name&mdash;a Major Charles Norton, of
my own Virginian regiment under General
Washington."
</p>

<p>
"He was my father."  And Norton's face
darkened.
</p>

<p>
"What, sir&mdash;your father!"  Colonel Taylor
drew rein suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  He brought his family west,
expecting to settle at Cincinnati&mdash;he was a
member of that society, of course, and was
attracted by the name.  He had barely
reached there when he found a message from
my Uncle John, who had gone to St. Louis.
My father decided to join him, and undertook
the trip with a brother officer named
Moore.
</p>

<p>
"This was in the fall of 1790, when I was
four years old.  During the winter my father
and Captain Moore built a large ark, and
early in the spring embarked both families,
with their property and slaves.  The ark passed
Louisville, and after that&mdash;it vanished."
</p>

<p>
"Good heavens, sir&mdash;what do you mean?"
demanded Colonel Taylor, staring.  Norton
smiled.
</p>

<p>
"River pirates.  I was fetched to
St. Louis by my old nigger mammy in a crazy
canoe; she died before she could more than
tell who I was, having been shot.  Beyond a
doubt the ark was surprised, either by
Indians or pirates, only my devoted old
black mammy getting me away.  The rest
were never heard from again&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Norton proceeded to give a brief account
of how his uncle had adopted him, later
removing to New Orleans, and of how his
own life had fitted him for the task in hand.
</p>

<p>
"Now, as you all know," he continued
calmly, "the river somewhere between here
and Fort Massac has been terrorized by a
band of river pirates.  Whether whites or
Indians, no one knows, for the simple
reason that they take no prisoners.  For some
reason the rumour has crept out that their
leader is called Blacknose, and is a member
of the old Mason gang.  This may or may
not be true&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"For heaven's sake, man, don't speak
that name!" broke out the younger Taylor.
"If any group discusses the name in these
parts, they suffer for it.  Dad urged the
Legislature to send out the militia to guard
the river against him; three days later our
barns were burned.  The same thing has
happened to other men.  We know nothing
more about the gang than you do, except
that it must have an excellent spy system."
</p>

<p>
Norton listened, his face setting into cold
lines.
</p>

<p>
"No one asks you to talk of him," he
returned grimly.  "I'll do all that's
necessary.  Three months ago the New Orleans
merchants got together to discuss the damages
being wrought upon the river-trade; they
knew I was a woodsman and that I had had
the luck to break up that Nagatoches gang,
so they came to me.  I accepted the task of
smashing this Blacknose, and I mean to do
it.  Gentlemen, my letters."
</p>

<p>
With this, he handed a letter each to
Boone and Taylor, then moved a few paces
on to the side of the lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
"See here, Norton," exclaimed the latter,
with a glance at his father, "let me join
you in&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Not much, Zach."  And Norton smiled
grimly.  "You're a farmer, not a woodsman;
besides, you've a bride to take care of.
No&mdash;that's final."
</p>

<p>
Taylor said no more, and John Norton
gazed out at the view beyond the little
rising knoll on which they stood.  It was
close enough to the river to be in sight of
the falls, and directly opposite them, on
the Indiana shore, was Clarksville.  Norton's
eye lingered a moment on the large house
which stood at the point of rocks; he had
learned on the previous day that this was
the home of George Rogers Clark, one of
the great frontier heroes, but now an old
man and crippled.
</p>

<p>
His gaze swept on to Louisville, half of
its one street hidden by a rising knoll of
cot ton woods.  The stone court-house, the
bell-roofed taverns, the Gault gardens at
the upper end of town&mdash;Norton looked past
these to Shippingsport, the little harbour
below the falls, and his eyes narrowed.
Here began his trail, as he knew well.
From Shippingsport went out every ounce of
freight to New Orleans from Louisville and
all points up-river, for only experienced
pilots could bring any craft through the
falls.  Louisville was to all intents the
starting-point of river traffic, and
somewhere between Louisville and Fort Massac,
at the juncture of the Ohio and Mississippi,
had vanished a full third of all the rich
cargoes sent down in the past three years.
</p>

<p>
Having already mapped out a vague plan
in his mind, he turned to the two older men,
and smiled slightly.  Boone had just finished
spelling out his letter painfully enough, and
was staring at it in disgust; Colonel Taylor
was looking at his horse's head with a stern
sadness, the cause of which the younger
man knew only too well.
</p>

<p>
"One moment, Colonel Dick," said Norton
gently.  The two gazed up quickly.  "I
wish to draw you into nothing which
can&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Captain Norton," broke in the other
sternly, "I have never refused to do my
duty, whatever the consequences, nor do I
intend to falter now.  My aid is yours, sir."
</p>

<p>
"You mistake me," smiled Norton, trying
to offset the hint of tragedy in the other's
eyes, "Since conditions here are as you
inform me, there is no reason for my
incriminating you.  If these river pirates really
have a spy system in effect, my mission
will be discovered sooner or later.  Do you
go on to town with Zach; from this moment
we are strangers.  The only good you can
do me is to request those whom you can
trust that they will supply all I demand and
draw on the New Orleans merchants who
signed that letter to you.  For your sake
and that of your family, do as I ask.  In
this manner you can serve me best.  Colonel
Boone will, I am sure, bear me out in this."
</p>

<p>
The old frontiersman nodded quickly.
Colonel Taylor hesitated, then stretched a
hand to Norton.
</p>

<p>
"God bless you, my boy&mdash;and if you need
help in the open, come to me."
</p>

<p>
Norton smiled, exchanged a handgrip and
a word with Lieutenant Taylor, and watched
father and son ride off toward the town.
Then he turned to Boone, to find the old
man looking glumly at him.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" he laughed questioningly.
"Has Blacknose taken the heart out of you,
or have you forgotten how to fire a rifle?"
</p>

<p>
To his intense amazement, Boone nodded
and spat in the road.
</p>

<p>
"Yep.  That's it.  See here, Norton: I
fit Injuns all my life and I ain't quit yet,
but my hide's got to feelin' good on my
back.  Now I'm goin' to help you, but I
ain't goin' to hunt them river pirates.  I
ain't ripe to die, not by a good ways!  No,
sir!  I'm a God-fearin' man, Norton, and
I ain't huntin' after trouble."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" queried the perplexed
Norton, taken utterly aback by the
old man's attitude.  "What can I count
on&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You listen here."  Boone's blue eyes
wandered off among the trees as he spoke.
"I ain't afeard o' no man livin', but I got
a wife to pervide for.  Now, we'll go down
to the tavern and I'll bring you a feller who
knows the hull country around here and
who'll act as go-betwixt for anything you
want.  How you fixed on the military end?"
</p>

<p>
"I've letters to General Harrison from
General Wilkinson, which will allow me to
make use of the militia if I wish.  Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, you 'tend to the military yourself
an' listen here."  Boone leaned over and
dropped his voice, his eyes still on the trees.
"Ye know where Blue River runs into the
Ohio?  Well, forty-five mile down the river
from here, an' twelve mile this side o' Blue
River, there's a big rocky cliff on the Injianny
shore, with a cabin an' mebbe more cabins
under it.  But <i>you</i> stay on the Kaintuck
side, mind.  D'reckly opposite that cliff,
ye'll find a big cottonwood blazed north an'
south.  Head right south from that there
tree, an' in less'n two mile you'll find a
cabin.  That's where Red Hugh lives.  Go
an' find him if he's there; if he ain't, wait
till he comes back.  Tell him 'bout me
sending ye, and ask fer help if ye need it."
</p>

<p>
"Who's Red Hugh?" demanded Norton, wondering.
</p>

<p>
"That's more'n I can tell ye."  And Boone
shook his head.  "I've knowed him off an'
on hard on twenty year.  He raises crops
there, an' goes on reg'lar spring an' fall
hunts after Injuns.  They killed off his
fam'ly, I reckon, an' God ain't softened his
heart yet&mdash;though He will some day, I
reckon.  He most gen'rally does&mdash;  <i>Lay
down</i>!  <i>Quick</i>!"
</p>

<p>
The last three words shot out with vehement
force; instinctively, Norton obeyed
the swift gesture and ducked forward.
Something sang over his head, almost brushing
his hair; there came a crack on the wind,
and he looked up to see a little drift of white
rise from a clump of cottonwoods a hundred
yards away.
</p>

<p>
Before he quite realized what had
happened, the rifle was torn out of his hand
and Boone was sighting.  The flint fell
uselessly, and with a muttered curse the
old frontiersman slipped from his horse and
ran for the trees whence had come the shot.
Norton, now comprehending, was after him
instantly.
</p>

<p>
Active though he was, he had hard work
keeping up with Boone.  Together they
gained the trees, to find nothing more than
a slight tinge of powder on the air, until
Boone leaned over the ground, pointing.
</p>

<p>
"Here he was, the skunk!  Come on, now."
</p>

<p>
His trained eye making out the tracks,
Norton followed.  After five minutes they
came out on Beargrass Creek, and on the
opposite shore was no trail.
</p>

<p>
"Slipped us," cried Boone savagely.
"Consarn him!  He might ha' gone up or
down, so let's git out o' here whilst our
hides are safe."
</p>

<p>
Whereupon, the old woodsman turned
and incontinently made for the horses, as
did Norton.  The assassin had had time to
reload, and tracking him in the river bed
was impossible.  When they had regained
the horses, Boone held out something to
Norton.
</p>

<p>
"Find the feller who owns this, an' ye've
got him.  I reckon your errand has slipped
out, friend."
</p>

<p>
Norton smiled faintly at the grim sarcasm
in the old man's voice, and looked at the
object.  It was the plug of a powder-horn
evidently dropped in haste.  Finely carved
in greyish horn, the stopper was crossed
lengthwise by a band of red.
</p>

<p>
"You find a feller with a horn what's got
a red streak in it," went on Boone, "and a
wooden plug; he's wearin' Shawnee moccasins
instead o' boots; he's left-handed,
'cause he rested his rifle that side o' the
tree, an' I wouldn't wonder but what he
was cross-eyed."
</p>

<p>
"Huh?  Why cross-eyed?" queried
Norton, frowning, and dropped the plug in
his shirt.
</p>

<p>
"'Cause he didn't see me a-watchin' them
trees," cackled the old man, and swung up
to his saddle.  "Now let's git away from
here; it makes me plumb scared.  What do
you reckon ye'll do first off?"
</p>

<p>
"Take advice," smiled Norton easily.
"All I can get.  I fancy the pirates are in
league with some one here, for they've
dropped on the best cargoes and let the poor
ones pass by.  It looks as if they had spies
here, sure enough."
</p>

<p>
"An' one of 'em's wearin' Shawnee
moccasins," chuckled Boone.  "Well, afore ye
git desp'rit, go see Red Hugh.  Now, you
git up to the tavern an' wait till I come.
I'm a-goin' to see Kitty Grigg."
</p>

<p>
"Kitty Grigg?"  Norton's mind went
back swiftly to the girl he had glimpsed on
the previous day.  "Who is she, Colonel?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, Ol' Abel Grigg 'lows she's his
daughter," returned the other slowly.
"'Fraid Abel ain't much account, though.
He was with me back in the Blue Lick
massacree, and cert'nly fit good, but went
bad later.  I've knowed Kathleen sence
afore I went to Missouri, and if she's Abel's
daughter, then, by gum, I'll sculp myself!"
</p>

<p>
"Grigg lives at Louisville, then?"
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;he's a hunter, mostly.  Has a farm
back o' town a piece.  Well, see ye later!
What tavern ye goin' to?"
</p>

<p>
"The 'Steuben Arms', just beyond Doctor
Gault's residence."
</p>

<p>
Boone nodded, and rode off along a forest
trail leading to the south, while Norton
pursued his course into town.
</p>

<p>
Who had fired that shot?  He thought of
Duval's threat, but Duval was no woodsman,
and the assassin was, as his method of
escape testified.  It seemed much more likely
that, as Boone had said, some hint of his
mission had leaked out.
</p>

<p>
How that could have been, Norton knew
not.  He had breathed no word of it to any
man from leaving New Orleans until reaching
the Taylor farm, nor had he discussed either
piracy in general or Blacknose in particular.
He had kept his ears open along the frontier
but had learned nothing; no one had ever
seen Blacknose, no one so much as knew
whether there were a Blacknose or not.
The name was a rumour, a border
myth&mdash;and only in Louisville was it backed up by
reality, reflected Norton.
</p>

<p>
He had not been sent on any false trail,
that was certain.  Neither the up-river
farmers and merchants nor those of New
Orleans could give him any definite
information; yet both they and Norton knew
well that in this year of grace, 1810, when
settlements and cabins were scattered all
along the Ohio and Mississippi, flatboat
after flatboat could not vanish into thin air
with their crews.
</p>

<p>
Norton's private opinion had been that
Blacknose was a renegade who led a band of
Indians and kept in touch with some one at
Louisville for information.  That opinion
was sorely shaken by what the Taylors had
said, however.  He began to think the whole
affair was engineered by river pirates alone,
and so rode slowly into town, lost in thought.
Nor did he forget the horn plug which now
reposed in his pocket.  Sooner or later he
would find the man who wore Shawnee
moccasins and whose powder-horn was
mottled with a red streak, and he promised
himself that something unpleasant would
happen to the gentleman in question.
</p>

<p>
As he splashed through the mud in front
of the courthouse, he saw the figure of Duval
going up the steps.  The lawyer had not
observed him, however, and Norton watched
him disappear inside.  For the Far West
the courthouse was a stately building, with
its two stories, ornate cupola, and handsome
pillars.
</p>

<p>
The Louisianian rode slowly on down the
one principal street toward the lower end of
town, and so came to the "Steuben Arms",
whose host had once served under the fiery
baron in the late war.  Indeed, it was for
this reason alone that Norton had chosen
the place, for it was none of the best; he
had been disappointed in finding Bower an
infirm, mumbling old veteran.
</p>

<p>
Dismounting, he gave his reins to the
waiting negro, nodded to old Bower as he
passed through the public room, and sought
his own chambers.  He had no desire to
hang about below-stairs, since the inn seemed
frequented by rivermen.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The morning was well advanced when, in
response to a knock, Norton opened the door
and admitted Colonel Boone and a stranger.
This stranger was a peculiar individual,
even for a time when the border was crowded
with peculiar personages.  He was dressed
in a dirty shirt with dirty ruffles, an ancient
beaver, ancient scarlet velvet breeches, shoes
which had burst at the toes, and a greatcoat
of reddish fustian.  Below a greasy and
dishevelled wig, his face was small and
pinched, yet very ruddy and healthy; he
seemed to Norton an odd little old man, and
his black eyes twinkled perpetually.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Norton, my friend, Mr. Elisha
Ayres, Gent.," declaimed Boone with something
like a grin.  "Ayres, young Norton's
the likeliest feller I've seen in a coon's age."
</p>

<p>
"That, sir," averred Mr. Ayres in a slow
and precise tone, "is a truer knighthood
than any which could be bestowed by the
crowned heads of the Old World!  I trust
you appreciate the honour, Mr. Norton, sir!
I am yours to command."
</p>

<p>
"You can trust Mr. Ayres, Norton,"
continued Boone.  "Now, I'm goin' to git
home.  Pow'ful glad I met ye, Norton, and
if ye need to do a little shootin', go find
Red Hugh.  Ye can trust Elisha&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You're not starting for Missouri&mdash;now?"
inquired the astonished Norton.
</p>

<p>
"Not yet&mdash;goin' to crack a bowl o' punch
at Doc Gault's first."  And Boone shook
hands with both men, then turned to the
door.  Norton had a last glimpse of the
barrel-like chest, grey hair, and keen eyes;
then Boone was gone with a final wave of
the hand.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Captain Norton," began Ayres in
his dry precise manner, "Colonel Boone
has told me of your mission in these parts,
sir.  I congratulate you heartily, sir, and
I congratulate these United States upon
having a public servant of your spirit&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Norton smiled to himself.  He began to
think that Boone had made the best of a bad
bargain by passing off the first person he
had picked up as an assistant.
</p>

<p>
"What is your business, Mr. Ayres?" he
inquired, wondering how best to get rid of
the ruddy-cheeked little man.
</p>

<p>
"I am a schoolmaster, sir"; and as he spoke,
Ayres settled back in his chair and pulled
forth a pipe.  "By the way, Mr. Norton,
the man who shot at you this morning is
a hunter from down-river.  His name I do
not know, but he wears a fox-skin cap with
the brush hanging, dresses in buckskin like
yourself, and wears a black beard."
</p>

<p>
Norton started.
</p>

<p>
"Are you jesting, sir?  Do you know this man?"
</p>

<p>
"I do not."  And Ayres fell to work with
flint and steel, until he had a light for his
pipe.  "I saw him last week, and chanced
to note the redstreaked powder-horn.  When
my friend Colonel Boone told me of it, I
remembered.  That is all.  Ah&mdash;one point
further&mdash;he was discussing some of our host's
excellent Virginia whisky, in company with
one Charles Duval, Gent., a fellow townsman
of mine."
</p>

<p>
While Norton was still trying to assimilate
the information imparted by this queer
individual, the bell on the roof banged out
its summons to dinner.  Ayres arose with
a grandiose bow.
</p>

<p>
"You will honour me, sir, by your company
below?  Then we can discuss matters
at our leisure."
</p>

<p>
Norton swallowed hard, nodded, and
followed to the door.  He began to think
that he had sadly misjudged Colonel Daniel
Boone.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III
</h3>

<p>
Norton rather regretted his hasty choice
of taverns.  The "Steuben Arms" had in its
day been a fine inn, but its day was done.
Located conveniently to Shippingsport, its
clientele now consisted largely of rivermen,
merchants, and such of the townsmen as
found its rates better suited to their purses
than those of the new taverns.
</p>

<p>
Passing through the deserted travellers'
room, Ayres led his guest on into the public
dining-room, where the long table was
already partially filled.  At the upper end
sat Bower, the host&mdash;a feeble old man with
tobacco-stained beard.  The overhead fans
were pulled by a negro girl in the corner.
</p>

<p>
Ayres settled down in a chair at an unoccupied
space, Norton following suit.  Then,
when the little man had nodded to Bower
and signed to a negro waiter, he turned and
spoke in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Mr. Norton, had you any definite
plan of action? ... Until the table
fills up, we will pass unnoticed."
</p>

<p>
Norton nodded, glancing around.  A
number of rivermen were talking loudly;
two or three merchants were discussing
prices&mdash;and profanity hung over the long
room like a cloud.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he returned slowly, "I thought
that a boat might be well laden here, quietly
pick up a force of men farther down the
river, and so be used as a lure.  With such
a spy system as seems to prevail, however,
that looks rather hopeless."
</p>

<p>
Ayres nodded.
</p>

<p>
"A good plan, sir, a good plan, yet doubtful
of success.  As you say, the people in
question would hear of it and you would be
laughed at for your pains.  The case, sir,
calls for circumspection."
</p>

<p>
"Quite so," agreed Norton drily, "Have
you any suggestions to make, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"I hope to have some, Captain Norton.
Granted that an organization exists, we may
presuppose it to be composed of white men.
Negroes or Indians would be sure to let out
the secret.  Given, then, white men: these
might be scattered settlers, or they might
be a small band of determined men
down-river, whose friends and directors work
from Louisville or some such point.  We
may take it, I trust, that one or two members
of the gang ship on the designated boats
and act as accomplices in the crime."
</p>

<p>
Ayres paused, in order to absorb a huge
pinch of snuff&mdash;after which he allowed the
waiter to get out of hearing, and prepared
to attack his dinner.
</p>

<p>
"You are aware," he went on calmly,
"that the richer cargoes go down in a fleet,
under an experienced commodore.  Invariably,
one or two boats vanish overnight&mdash;but
never at the same point in the river.
It would be easy for a member of the crew
to untie the moorings and let the boat slip
down the stream.  Now, remember these
points; and remember also that if there is
a down-river band, they must have a hiding-place
where the stolen cargoes can be stored
away until disposed of."
</p>

<p>
Concluding his speech with extreme haste,
Ayres abruptly began his dinner as the
nearer seats were filled up.  Gathering that
the discussion was ended for the present,
Norton applied himself to dinner also.
Whisky was circulating freely, and while
they ate, the rivermen filled the room with
tales of river life, most of which were more
spicy than refined.
</p>

<p>
"Gen'lemen, yew hear me!" broke out
one of two men opposite Norton&mdash;a big,
hairy man of immense build.  His companion
was bronzed, gloomy-eyed, and stern-faced,
and both had been absorbing vast
quantities of white whisky.  "Gen'lemen,"
boomed the big fellow, glaring around,
"thar's gwine to be war.  I'm tellin' yew!
War!  Yew hear me!"
</p>

<p>
"We hear ye all right," piped up a shrill
voice.  "Who's the war with?"
</p>

<p>
"Gen'lemen, your health!"  And the big
man emptied his glass.  "Thet thar feller
they call the Prophet&mdash;the one-eyed crazy
dog, he's a-stirrin' up the Injuns.  Yew
hear me, gen'lemen, ol' man Harrison
he's gwine to need Kaintuck rifles afore
long!  Who said ol' Dan'l Boone was in
town?"
</p>

<p>
Whereupon there followed an excited
discussion of Boone.  In the midst, the
gloomy-eyed companion of the big man brought
down his fist with a crash on the table.
</p>

<p>
"This here generation's got to suffer for
its sins!" he roared out in a vibrant voice,
fastening his eye on Norton.  "Friends,
read the prophecies of the inspired Richard
Brother!  There'll ye find set forth about
the Injun war, and the cursed Federals
ruining the country!  That there inspired
man, he was a prophet.  Damnation to the
Federals, say&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The gloomy-eyed man said no more, for
a roar went up at his words.
</p>

<p>
"Ye drunken Democrat," cried some one,
"take that!"
</p>

<p>
With which a heavy pitcher of molasses
struck the gloomy-eyed man above the ear,
smashed, and sent him down senseless.  His
big companion sprang up like a cat, drew
back his arm, and a knife flashed across the
room in a flame of glittering light.  It did
no harm, save to precipitate a general fight.
Norton was just rising to escape, when a
deep cold voice broke in upon the uproar:
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen, make way!"
</p>

<p>
Norton started.  He looked up to see the
figure of Duval entering the door, against
which two fighting cursing men had reeled.
Duval took them by the shoulders and tore
them apart; one went spinning down the
room; the other crashed into the wall, and
the lawyer strode forward.
</p>

<p>
That display of strength was not lost
upon John Norton, nor the calm which
instantly followed.  Instead of being mobbed,
Duval seemed to inspire these rivermen with
fear&mdash;all save the big hairy man opposite
Norton.  He alone paid no heed; having
caught the man who had laid out his
companion, he was administering a sound
thrashing when Duval caught him by the shoulder
and tore him loose.
</p>

<p>
"Go to your seat," commanded Duval,
cold and immobile.  The other glared at him.
</p>

<p>
"Who the devil are yew?" he demanded
hoarsely.  "Take yer hand off'n me&mdash;I'm
liable to sculp ye!  Yew hear me!  I'm
gwine to lay out this cussed Federal.  I
don't care ef he's Blacknose hisself!"
</p>

<p>
A startled silence fell, while Duval still
gazed coldly into the big man's eyes.  There
was something terrible in the lawyer's
immobility; then Norton saw that he was holding
a small pistol against the big man's
chest.
</p>

<p>
"Go to your seat," he repeated icily.
The other felt the pistol, glanced down at
it, and obeyed sullenly.  Norton felt a
hand on his arm.
</p>

<p>
"Let us go, sir," murmured Ayres very
softly.  Norton nodded, rose, and they left
the room together.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Five minutes later they were sitting side
by side in the chairs before the tavern, pipes
out.  Norton's thoughts were dwelling on
this man Duval, and he wondered afresh
if the lawyer had been behind that attempted
assassination of the morning.  The man
hardly seemed of such a nature; he had
quieted the rivermen by sheer force of voice
and muscle, and was plainly a man known
and feared.
</p>

<p>
"Who is this Duval?" asked Norton,
glancing at his friend.
</p>

<p>
"A lawyer, sir, who speaks of going to
the Legislature next fall.  He comes of a
good Virginia family, settled here some
three years since, and has a fair practice.
A rising man, sir, a rising man.  One of
our ablest citizens, and already talks of
raising a company in case General Harrison
has trouble with the redskins."
</p>

<p>
Norton thought he detected a faint hint
of sarcasm in the precise voice, but Ayres's
pinched, red-cheeked face was expressionless.
</p>

<p>
"Well, have you any sort of plan, Mr. Ayres?"
</p>

<p>
"An excellent one, sir," came the surprising
answer.  Ayres knocked out his pipe
slowly.  "I would suggest that you follow
Colonel Boone's advice, and go to see this
man Red Hugh, of whom he told you.
When you have seen him, you may expect
a messenger from me at the Blue River
settlement&mdash;on the Kentucky side, remember,
for there are two.  I may find it feasible to
put your prior plan into operation and use
a rich-laden flatboat for lure."
</p>

<p>
"Hm!"  Norton looked at the other
keenly.  "Do you seriously believe that
Duval had anything to do with the man who
shot at me this morning?"
</p>

<p>
He was amazed, upon meeting the black
eyes of his friend, to find them in a terrible
earnestness.
</p>

<p>
"Sir,"&mdash;and the dry precise voice quivered
the slightest bit&mdash;"it is my honest belief
that if you remain in this town overnight,
you will be murdered."
</p>

<p>
Startled, Norton gave the other a keen
look.  Then he smiled slightly.
</p>

<p>
"Murdered?  Man, what do you mean?
Is that gang&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I cannot say what I mean, sir," returned
Ayres, rising.  "I hardly know myself.  God
forgive me if I misjudge Charles Duval!
But, sir, this is my sincere advice: go and
find Red Hugh, and go within the hour.
You are a woodsman; therefore go by the
trails and not by boat.  Trust no man.
Sir, I&mdash;I have been doing much quiet
investigation of late, and I am appalled.  The
whole thing is indefinite and terrible.  Most
of what was said in the dining-room there
was lost upon you, but not upon me; and,
sir, I will make you this prediction: That
big riverman, who only came in from
Cincinnati to-day, and who took the name of
Blacknose in vain&mdash;that man will die."
</p>

<p>
"Good Heavens, Ayres!"  Norton rose,
aghast at the solemn earnestness of the little
schoolmaster.  "Do you know what you're
saying?  This isn't the Indian border,
but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Sir, this is Louisville, State of Kentucky,
in the thirty-fourth year of the Independence
of the United States of America," responded
Ayres gravely.  He bowed.  "You may
count upon hearing from me, Mr. Norton,
at Dodd's tavern at the Blue River settlement.
Let your task be to scour the woods
and settlements, meantime.  Sir, your
servant, and&mdash;and may God keep you!"
</p>

<p>
Whereupon, with another bow, the little
man turned and marched stiffly away, his
absurd beaver cocked jauntily over one ear
and his fustian greatcoat fluttering behind
him.  Norton stared after him, then sank
into his chair and drew out his tobacco.
</p>

<p>
"By thunder!" he muttered slowly to
himself, the while he stuffed his pipe,
watching the lessening figure.  "I seem to
have set foot in a hornet's nest&mdash;and came
near to getting stung this morning!  Now,
I wonder what that little fox of a schoolmaster
suspects, and why he imagines I am
in danger here in the town itself!"
</p>

<p>
The very thought was amusing to Norton.
He knew very well that in such centres of
civilization as New Orleans, St. Louis, and
Louisville, men did not condone murder.
Even in the newer river settlements, the
older generation who had passed through
the lawless pioneer days were savagely set
upon upholding a rude justice.  Boone
himself exampled this, for Norton had heard
of how the old frontiersman had made himself a
terror while acting as magistrate in Missouri.
</p>

<p>
That he had anything to fear in Louisville,
therefore, seemed impossible to Norton.
Duval might well have hired the assassin of
the morning; yet it was more likely that
some hint of his mission had leaked out,
thought the Louisianian.  There was most
certainty a secret organization of
river-pirates; so much had been amply proved to
him, but he was still inclined to smile at the
terror it inspired.
</p>

<p>
"Still," he reflected sagely, "men like
Taylor and Boone aren't exactly fools.  And
I rather believe Elisha Ayres is no fool,
either.  So, my assailant is black-bearded,
wears a brushed fox-skin cap, and has a
red-streaked powder-horn!  Something
gained, at all events.  Mr. Ayres, I believe
I will heed your warning."
</p>

<p>
Having plenty of money, Norton called
one of the negroes loafing in the sun and
ordered his horse saddled, then went down
the street to the store of Audubon &amp; Rosier,
where he found the junior partner and
purchased a few supplies.  As he was leaving,
Rosier leaned over the counter with a cautious
glance at the door.
</p>

<p>
"Your pardon, sir I believe your name
is Norton?"
</p>

<p>
"It is, sir," returned the surprised
Louisianian.
</p>

<p>
"Colonel Taylor spoke to me of you,"
went on the other rapidly.  "You may rely
upon us absolutely, sir.  If by chance you
meet my partner somewhere in the woods,
do not fear to trust him.  He is slightly
touched in the head, but save for his long
wanderings is&mdash;"  A man passed outside,
and without a change in his low tone Rosier
continued.  "As I was saying, sir, General
Harrison can control the Indians excellently&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Norton took the hint and passed out with
a nod, storing away in his mind the name
of the senior partner, Audubon.  It occurred
to him that if he was joining forces with a
hermit Indian-slayer and a schoolmaster, a
half-crazed merchant who evidently spent
his time wandering in the woods would
make a good third.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Returning to the tavern, he found it
deserted in front, though a murmur of loud
voices came from the dining-room.  It seemed
slightly odd that dinner was not yet over,
but he went to his room, got his things,
and after some search located Bower's
daughter in the kitchens.  He paid her his bill,
then went around to the front for his horse.
</p>

<p>
Now John Norton was no fool, as may
have been previously inferred.  Despite his
respect for the law, Ayres's words had set
his nerves on edge, in conjunction with
what had happened that day.  Like all
woodsmen, he much preferred danger in the
woods to danger in the town; as he tied his
purchases and rifle to his saddle, he found
himself glancing nervously over his shoulder.
And even as he set foot in the stirrup, he
paused.
</p>

<p>
There was a horrible shuffling step from
the doorway behind, and he whirled, hand
on knife, to see the big hairy riverman
clutching the door-post.  The giant's face
was terribly convulsed, and one hand gripped
at a knife-haft whose blade was buried in
his side.  Barely had Norton comprehended,
when the man pulled the knife free, coughed,
and fell dead.  With the same instant there
rose a shrill yell from the doorway behind,
and men came crowding out.
</p>

<p>
"There he is!  Thar's the murderer!"
went up the shout.  "Git him, boys!"
</p>

<p>
A pistol flashed, and the ball sang past
Norton's ear.  Dodging behind his horse,
he realized everything in a flash; Ayres's
prediction had proved terribly true, and
what was worse, the murderers were trying
to fasten the crime on him.  More, they
were trying to kill him before he had a
chance to deny his guilt.  Whether Duval's
work or not&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Sensing all this as he dodged, Norton
wasted neither time nor movement.  Before
the first of the crowd poured out across the
dead man, he made a flying leap for the
saddle, gained it, and sent his horse ahead
on the jump.  He knew his one chance lay
in getting out of town within the hour&mdash;as
Ayres had predicted.
</p>

<p>
Another pistol cracked behind him, and
another.  The balls whistled harmlessly
past, but served to draw attention.  Several
men leaped into the road, shouting; Norton
drove his horse at them with a yell, and
they fell away.  Without thought, he had
headed up-town and now had no choice but
to continue his way along the south road.
</p>

<p>
The last of the fine brick houses was
almost past, and the uproar behind him
was being swelled by voices and bells.  The
final house was a splendid mansion&mdash;Norton
knew it for that of a Doctor Gault.  As he
pounded past the terraced gardens, he glanced
up to the doorway and caught sight of a
group of figures&mdash;Colonel Taylor, Zach,
Boone and others.  A wave of the hand
came to him, a shouted farewell, and
Louisville fell behind.
</p>

<p>
"And now for the chase," thought Norton
grimly, pulling in his steed a trifle.  "They'll
fasten that murder on me and get me&mdash;if
they can.  It's a neat manner to be rid of
an enemy&mdash;the second attempt in one morning,
the day after my arrival in town!  Now
I would call that quick work, brainy work,
but desperate work.  Whoever he is,
Blacknose fears me&mdash;good!  If I can match
his villainy with honest woodcraft, he shall
fear me more."
</p>

<p>
Twisting in the saddle, Norton looked
back, having caught a sudden thud of hoofs.
He thundered past a cross-roads, and
although the town was shut out behind, the
horseman who followed was plainly visible.
He wore a crushed beaver-hat, scarlet
breeches, and a fluttering greatcoat; as
Norton gazed in amazement, the other waved
him onward.  Ayres, for it was no other,
drew up at the cross-roads, carefully
spattered mud over the road from a puddle,
then departed at a gallop by the eastern
track and was lost to sight.
</p>

<p>
"Covering my trail&mdash;the old fox!"
exclaimed Norton.  "Mr. Ayres, my
compliments.  You may be a schoolmaster, but
John Norton owes you his life this day!"
</p>

<p>
And he rode on to the south.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
</h3>

<p>
That there would be pursuit Norton knew
well enough.  He knew also that if he were
caught, he would not be brought back to
Louisville alive; Blacknose, being a person
of sufficient wit to make so shrewd and swift
a plot, would have him safely shot in order
to preclude all possible danger.  Once past
Sullivan's ferry, where the post-road crossed
the Ohio to Vincennes seven miles below
Shippingsport, Norton knew that he would
have the wilderness ahead and his own good
wits to rely upon.
</p>

<p>
More than once he pondered on the subject
of Charles Duval.  He more than suspected
the lawyer of being at the bottom of the
affair at the tavern, though this seemed
hardly possible on sober second thought.
He had seen nothing of Duval in the crowd
about the door, but the memory of how the
man had silenced the riot during dinner
still remained with him.  Duval had
influence, it seemed, and he was also a
prominent citizen.
</p>

<p>
John Norton was pre-eminently just.  He
admitted to himself that he had taken an
instant dislike to Duval upon meeting the
latter on the Beargrass Creek Road the day
before.  The dislike was based on no solid
ground.  Duval was the type of man best
fitted to capture the liking of
frontiersmen&mdash;strong, powerful, unafraid and brainy.
None the less, Norton did not like him.
Either, he considered, his errand had been
noised abroad and the river-pirates had
tried to eliminate him that morning, or
else Duval had been behind the two attempts
on his life.
</p>

<p>
"And if I'm to take my choice," he
thought, "I'd say it was the pirates."
</p>

<p>
None the less, it was with a distinct shock
that a moment later he recognized Charles
Duval slowly riding toward him.  Norton
drew rein, astounded.
</p>

<p>
His track had degenerated into a mere
forest trail, since he had struck away from
the main pike which Ayres had followed,
to throw off the pursuers.  Trees were on
every side, and Norton could only conjecture
that he had come some four miles from the
town.  Yet here was Duval riding toward
him&mdash;Duval, whom he had supposed was
even then urging on his pursuers!
</p>

<p>
With him was walking a man, and Norton
eyed the pair keenly enough as they
approached.  Duval's horse was warm, but
not foam-flecked, and it was a warm day;
the lawyer had been doing no furious riding;
so much was clear.  Almost reluctantly,
Norton instantly absolved him of any
complicity in the plot at the tavern.  The man
with him was very tall and gaunt, dressed
in backwoods style, carried a rifle, had a
bushy grizzled beard, a thin, hooked nose
and very deep-set dark eyes.  He had not
been at the tavern.
</p>

<p>
The pair sighted Norton almost as he saw
them, and stopped for an instant in evident
surprise.  He saw Duval say something in
a low voice; then both came forward.  To
Norton's great surprise, the lawyer advanced
with hand outstretched and a smile upon his
face which seemed sincere enough.
</p>

<p>
"Sir," exclaimed Duval heartily, "I must
ask your pardon for my words of yesterday.
I was somewhat in liquor, and irritated at
the moment.  May I have the honour of
your name, sir?"
</p>

<p>
Norton, with no hint of his inward amazement,
gripped the other's proffered hand and
looked squarely into Duval's dark eyes.  He
read there only a sincere regret, however,
and after giving his name proceeded to
compliment the lawyer on his evident prestige
among the rivermen as exemplified at the
tavern that noon.  Duval's eyes narrowed
a trifle.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I saw you go out," he returned,
"and left myself shortly after.  As to those
flatboat-men, if some one did not overawe
them occasionally they would run the town.
By the way, Mr. Norton, meet Mr. Grigg,
one of our old settlers and a solid farmer of
the vicinity."
</p>

<p>
This designation seemed to draw a grin
from Grigg, who stuck up a huge paw with
a muttered "Howdy!" to Norton.  The
latter found the backwoodsman's face a
mixture of savagery, cunning and boldness;
he wondered idly what Duval had to do with
such a man.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Grigg and a neighbour are having a
land dispute," smiled Duval smoothly, as
if reading the thought of Norton, "but we
hope to settle it out of court.  Thinking of
buying a farm hereabouts?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I'm just on a tour," returned Norton
easily.  "I'm from Cincinnati, originally."
</p>

<p>
Which was quite true, but misleading.
For one thing, Norton recollected that the
man Grigg must be the father of the
strikingly beautiful girl he had met on the
Beargrass Creek Road yesterday; also,
Colonel Boone's description of Grigg did
not quite coincide with that just given by
Duval.  Remembering what Boone had said
regarding Grigg's parentage of the girl,
Norton eyed the man with no great favour.
</p>

<p>
Duval, of course, seemed to have no
suspicion of what had happened at the
tavern&mdash;which happening, indeed, having been
too recent for him to know of it.  Norton
concluded the lawyer had left the place
while he was absent at the store of Audubon
&amp; Rosier, and that after his leaving, the
rivermen had formulated their plot.  He wondered
vaguely whether or not the redoubtable
Blacknose himself had been present at dinner.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I must be going forward," he said.
"Can you tell me if this trail will lead me
around toward the river?"
</p>

<p>
"After a bit," nodded Duval, inspecting
Norton's outfit piece by piece.  "It runs
past Mr. Grigg's farm, then forks.  Take
the fork to the left, which circles around to
the river a few miles down.  Your servant, sir!"
</p>

<p>
He bowed, Norton returning the compliment,
and the three separated.
</p>

<p>
Passing through some marshy cane-brake,
the Louisianian presently came to higher
ground, found the trees thinning, and
perceived hemp and tobacco fields to the
right.  He was thinking of his own
situation, however, and wondering at Duval's
change of front.  What had caused the
lawyer to take this sudden attitude?
</p>

<p>
Norton himself was a man who neither
explained nor apologised for his own actions,
and knew Duval for the same kind of man.
There must be something behind his abrupt
apology and surprising amiability, he
concluded, though he was at a loss to conceive
what it might be.  Colonel Taylor had
spoken none too warmly of Duval the day
before, else he might have thought that
Taylor had mentioned him and his errand
to the lawyer, as he had done to Rosier.
</p>

<p>
"By thunder!" frowned Norton, gazing
at the few negroes at work in the fields
among the scattered stumps and girdled trees.
"There's something almighty strange about
this whole affair.  Well, I'm out of it now,
and if they can reach me in the woods&mdash;let
them!  I guess I'll call on the charming
Madam Kitty Grigg.  Hm!  Duval seems to
have been ahead of me there, too.  I'm
afraid that if I lingered in Louisville,
Mr. Duval and I would get farther than
apologies&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He laughed a little, feeling that if he came
to hand-grips with Duval the result might be
dubious, but worth chancing.  And so he
came to Grigg's cabin, for farm it was not.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
There was no mistaking the place; the
girl herself was sitting on the steps of the log
shack, at work sewing.  Behind him, Norton
saw the back-ends of the plantations he had
passed, whose buildings were perhaps a
mile or more distant.  Grigg's cabin was
placed amid a grove of half-dead maple and
walnut&mdash;girdled but never cleared.  Even
as Norton drew rein and dismounted, the
girl rising at sight of him, a sudden thought
came into his mind: Duval had said that he
was in liquor the day before.  Now Norton
had seen enough drunken men to know that
Duval lied in that statement.
</p>

<p>
Dismissing this thought, however, he
advanced to the shack with a smile.  He
had no cap and had neglected to buy one in
town, and his brown hair and bronzed face
were very good to look upon in the warm
afternoon sunlight.
</p>

<p>
"This is Madam Kitty Grigg?" he smiled,
bowing, "I met your father and Mr. Duval
upon the road, and finding that I had to pass
here, determined to crave the courtesy of
a drink of water."
</p>

<p>
She looked at him steadily for a moment,
one hand at her breast.  Once again Norton
noted the clear beauty of her grey eyes and
gold-red hair, the character and fresh
womanliness of her whole face.
</p>

<p>
"Sir&mdash;you met&mdash;my father and Mr. Duval?"
she said slowly.  Norton comprehended
the alarm in her eyes, and laughed
again.
</p>

<p>
"Aye, that I did, Kitty!" he cried gaily.
"And your Mr. Duval did me the honour
of an apology for what happened on the
Beargrass Creek Road yesterday.  But
pardon&mdash;my name is John Norton, at your
service now and always."
</p>

<p>
She looked into his eyes for a moment
longer, then turned and walked around the
corner of the house, beckoning.  Norton
followed, to find a spring trickling up
beneath a crab-apple tree.  Gravely, she
dipped out a gourd of water, held it to
him, and he drank.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, Kitty!" he sighed.  "You have
nigh saved my life this day&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Then you had best save it for yourself,"
she returned quickly, yet with a laugh in
her eyes, "by departing speedily.  If Charles
Duval gave you an apology, look to your
steps, sir!"
</p>

<p>
"Eh?"  Startled out of his gay mood,
Norton looked keenly at her.  "Now what
may you mean by that, sweet Kitty?"
</p>

<p>
The girl, however, only shrugged her
shoulders and laughed.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis easy to see you are from Louisiana,
Mr. Norton"&mdash;and he marvelled at the ringing
timbre of her voice&mdash;"since from you it
is 'Kitty' and 'sweet Kitty', while our
Kentuckians will ever have it 'Madam
Grigg' or mayhap 'Miss Kathleen'."
</p>

<p>
"Faith, I had it <i>Kitty</i> from Colonel
Boone," laughed Norton easily.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but he is an old family friend&mdash;a
second father."  Abruptly, the girl fell
serious, and put out an imploring hand to
his arm, as she glanced at the trail.  "Pray,
Mr. Norton&mdash;go at once!  You are in danger,
I assure you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit of it," broke in Norton soberly.
"I'm in the woods to get out of danger,
Miss Kitty.  Even now, I suspect that
horsemen are searching for me on the
Lexington post-road.  But I would like to
know what makes you think I am in
danger&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Because my father allows no one around
here"&mdash;and the girl drew back with a slight
flush.  Norton thought of Duval, but
forbore to mention the obvious.  "But&mdash;what
do you mean?  Why are men searching for
you?  Are you jesting?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's more or less of a joke," he
laughed, seeing her quick alarm.  Plainly,
she knew more than did he; whether from
Abel Grigg or not, danger threatened and
she was afraid.  So, with a light air, he told
her of what had chanced at the tavern.
</p>

<p>
She listened quietly, her eyes flitting
from his face to the trees and back again.
She was stirred out of herself.  Norton had
never seen so rare a girl in all his life&mdash;clear,
incisive, with grey eyes that could
harden into ice or sparkle into star-glints.
The brown homespun fell loosely enough
about her slender figure, but Norton's fancy
transformed it into brocade, and he imagined
this girl as she would look were she dressed
in the fashion of the New Orleans belles.
</p>

<p>
"By gad," he thought to himself, reaching
the end of his story, "Boone was right!
She is no daughter of Grigg's.  What a
glorious girl she is!"
</p>

<p>
"Evidently, sir, it was a plot against
you," she said, her brow wrinkling
deliciously in thought.  "But why did you not
stay and face the absurd charge?"
</p>

<p>
"For many reasons"&mdash;and Norton was
instantly on guard&mdash;"chief of which was
that I have important business down the
river.  I believe that I take the left fork
from this trail, do I not?"
</p>

<p>
"If you wish to reach the Tennessee
settlements, yes," she returned drily.  "If you
want to reach the river, take the right fork,
which brings you out just below the post-road
at Sullivan's ferry."
</p>

<p>
"Eh?  You are certain of that?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course!"  There was wonder in the
clear grey eyes.  "Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no reason at all&mdash;I must have been
hugely mistaken in my notions of your
roads hereabouts," he smiled.  "You see,
I am going to the Blue River settlements
and am a stranger in this country.  Did you
see Colonel Boone this morning?"
</p>

<p>
Norton was not at all surprised to find
that Duval had directed him to the wrong
road.  He had half suspected as much, and
guessed that when the lawyer reached town
he would set the pursuers going in the right
direction.  He was, however, no little
astonished when the girl shook her head in
reply to his casual question.  Though Boone
had not said it in so many words, he had
distinctly understood that the frontiersman
had seen the girl that morning.
</p>

<p>
"No, Mr. Norton&mdash;I was looking for him
even now.  Was he in town?"
</p>

<p>
"He came to town with me from Colonel
Dick Taylor's this morning, Kitty&mdash;or let
us say Kathleen, which is more dignified
and has a right Irish touch to it.  I thought
he had intended to visit you long ere this!"
</p>

<p>
"So had I," she returned, her eyes on the
circling trees.  "Still, he will be here before
he leaves Kentucky.  He was doubtless
detained on business."
</p>

<p>
Norton nodded, remembering Elisha Ayres.
Probably Boone had sought the little
schoolmaster and the latter had detained him.
Well, so much the better; friends were at
work, and there seemed to be sore need of
them all.
</p>

<p>
"When you see him, then, tell him of
seeing me here," said the Louisianian.  It
would be well to have Boone kept informed.
"He is a very good friend&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Wait," the girl broke in quietly,
frowning.  "What are you going to do?  If the
rivermen are after you, as it seems they are,
you would be very foolish to take the river
trail&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I am a woodsman, sweet Kitty," he
laughed easily, "and I am willing to take
my chance against any white man save
only Boone&mdash;and perhaps one other.  Would
that honest Davy Crockett were here with
me!  He and I have had many a trail
together, but&mdash;well, no matter.  Trust me,
Kitty; the forest can harm me not."
</p>

<p>
"But the river can, my confident paladin
of Louisiana!  Bethink you, the rivermen
can use canoes to get ahead of you, lay an
ambush&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Norton uttered an ejaculation.  She was
right&mdash;he had overlooked the river.  With
a sudden anxiety in his brown eyes, he
looked at her gravely, thinking hard.  His
was no lack of self-reliance, else he had not
been on this present errand.  But he was in
a strange country, and the Kentuckians and
rivermen were strange to him; above all, to
find himself so swiftly and shrewdly attacked,
as he had been that morning, was
disconcerting.  He longed for some man at his
back, some man like young Crockett or
old Boone, not dreaming what manner of
man Fate was even then leading to his
comradeship.
</p>

<p>
"What think you I had best do, Madam
Kathleen?" he asked quietly.  She flushed
a little under his serious eyes, but met the
look frankly.
</p>

<p>
"Take the Tennessee trail," she returned
slowly.  "Since you are a woodsman, and
look it, this will be easy for you.  Take the
fork to the left, as you first intended; after
a few miles, strike west and work back
north to the river gradually, through the
woods.  Blue River is only forty-five miles
distant.  Do your enemies know your destination?"
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;it is known only to Mr. Elisha
Ayres, who is my friend and helper."
</p>

<p>
"Oh&mdash;you know him, then!"  The grey
eyes widened suddenly, and he was amazed
at their quick friendliness and warmth.
"Why, 'twas he who taught me learning!
Well, then, by all means circle around
through the woods to the Blue River, and
God preserve you, sir!"
</p>

<p>
"I doubt not He will," responded Norton
gravely.
</p>

<p>
He knelt beside the spring and dipped the
gourd, more as an excuse for his stay than
because he wished a drink.  The girl refused
the proffered vessel, and Norton put it to
his lips.
</p>

<p>
As he drank, his eyes fell on the shadow
cast by the corner of the log cabin.  A tuft
of grass suddenly leaped from shadow to
sunshine; some moving object at the corner
of the cabin had caused the change.  Norton
was on his feet instantly, and a leap took
him to the corner, hand on knife.
</p>

<p>
Quick as he was, he found the front of
the cabin deserted.  His horse was grazing
quietly; there was no flutter of leaves, no
swing of branches, to show that anyone had
fled hastily into the trees.  Half-wondering
if he had been mistaken, he glanced down
at the ground by the cabin corner, as the
alarmed Kathleen joined him.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" he cried swiftly, stooping over a
faint mark on the ground.  "Get me that
rifle from my saddle, Kitty!  Here is a
gentleman who wears a patched moccasin&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Stop!"  The girl caught his arm as he
rose, and her face was set in swift alarm.
"It was my father&mdash;I told you he did not
like to have strangers around!  I patched that
moccasin myself&mdash;please go, and quickly!"
</p>

<p>
"Hm!"  Norton looked at her.  "Does it
occur to you, Kathleen, that your worthy
father may have overheard what we said
about my journey?  By the way, are you
so certain that he is your father?"
</p>

<p>
"Why&mdash;what mean you?"  The colour
ebbed from her cheeks as she gazed at him.
"Of course he is my father!  Please depart,
sir&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, I dislike to be hurried."  And
Norton calmly pulled out his pipe.  He was
angry, but it showed only in his narrowed
eyes.  "Now our mutual friend, Colonel
Boone, seems to have an idea that Abel
Grigg is not your father, sweet Kitty.  I confess
that the same thought has come to me, since
seeing him.  Have you any coals inside?"
</p>

<p>
She stamped her foot, half in anger and
half in dismay.
</p>

<p>
"Good lack, sir, will you not be gone?"
</p>

<p>
"Not until you fetch me a coal, at all
events."
</p>

<p>
She looked at him, read determination
in his face, and with an impatient gesture
ran to the cabin door and vanished inside.
After a moment she appeared with a brand
in her fingers, evidently pulled from the
fire inside.  Smiling, he took it and set it
to his pipe.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, that is better!  Now, Kitty, as to
your birth: Do you know anything of your
mother?"
</p>

<p>
He fully expected fresh expostulation
from her; instead, she nodded quietly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, though I do not conceive your
right to question me, sir."
</p>

<p>
"My right is the interest of a gentleman,"
he said gravely, and she flushed.  "May I
ask who your mother was?"
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I do not know her name," stammered
the girl, helpless wonder in her eyes.  "Her
initials were H.E.M., but my father never
speaks of her."
</p>

<p>
"You mean, Abel Grigg never speaks of
her," corrected Norton.  A new anger
flashed into the girl's face.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you are insufferable!" she cried
bitterly.  "I have tried to help you, and
your impertinent curiosity&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, Kitty, it is only the interest of a
gentleman, as I said before," smiled Norton,
"Still, you are right.  My curiosity is
impertinent, it may be, and if you were not the
fairest maid I think I have ever seen, perhaps
my interest in you would be less.  Frankly, I
expect to return to this vicinity before a
great while, and shall look forward to seeing
you again.  But tell me, please&mdash;how is it
that you know your mother's initials, but
not her name?"
</p>

<p>
She looked at him for a long moment,
divided between anger at his cool insistence
and comprehension of the iron will behind
his gentle courtesy.  Her hand went to her
dress.
</p>

<p>
"Because of this.  It used to be my
mother's, father has said&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She laid a pin in his hand, and Norton
stared down at it in rank incredulity.  He
turned it over and saw the graven initials
on the back, "H.E.M."  Then, reaching
inside his buckskin coat, he brought out its
duplicate and laid it beside the other.  Both
pins were identical&mdash;a small golden eagle,
with half-obliterated enamel.
</p>

<p>
"By thunder!" said Norton very softly,
"Kitty, do you know what this is?"
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;a pin, that's all," she looked up
at him, perplexed.  He turned over his own
pin, showing her the twined initials graven
there, "C.N.&mdash;E.D."
</p>

<p>
"This was my only legacy from my
father," he continued slowly.  "Ask Colonel
Boone to tell you the story.  My father was
Charles Norton, my mother Eliza Darby&mdash;their
initials, you see.  But how on earth
did you get yours?  It could not have
belonged to your mother, unless your father
had given it her.  And if Abel Grigg was
an officer in the Revolution&mdash;then I'm a liar!"
</p>

<p>
"But what is it?" she queried, wide-eyed.
He came to her side, pointing to the two
little gold eagles, and explained:
</p>

<p>
"This broken enamel, here, showed Cincinnatus
at the plough&mdash;the Roman story, if
you remember"&mdash;and she nodded to his
words.  "The motto was '<i>Omnia relinquit
servare rempublicam</i>'.  Kitty, this eagle is
from the order of the Society of the
Cincinnati, composed only of Revolutionary
officers and their eldest male descendants.
I am a member, in virtue of my father's
having been one before me&mdash;but how on
earth did you get this?  Does your father
know what it is?"
</p>

<p>
"No, because I have asked him," she
returned, excited interest in her eyes.  "He
says it is just a bauble&mdash;but please, please
go now!  He was here, and I'm afraid
that&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Very well, Kitty."  And returning one
of the eagles to her, he replaced the other
beneath his leathern shirt.  "Say nothing
to him of this, mind.  I'll investigate it
when I return.  Farewell&mdash;and remember,
I'll come back sooner or later!"
</p>

<p>
He raised her hand to his lips, bowing,
and turned to his horse.  He scarcely
remembered more than that he rode off with a
wave of his hand; his brain was in a wild
riot of thought. It was a moral certainty
that Abel Grigg had no right to wear that
golden eagle, and in fact knew nothing
about it&mdash;where, then, had Kathleen Grigg's
eagle come from?
</p>

<p>
"'Just a bauble,' eh?" muttered Norton,
his lips tightening in anger. "Friend Grigg,
I would be pleased to have you repeat those
words to me! By thunder, you'd learn
something about the Revolution in a
confounded hurry!"
</p>

<p>
And so he rode off into the wilderness,
nor looked back to see the girl gazing after
him, hands at her breast.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V
</h3>

<p>
Gradually, Norton's mind settled out of
chaos into order.  The girl was no daughter
of Abel Grigg; so much was certain.  He
felt a hot anger at thought of her in the
hands of such a man.  There was no chance
that Grigg had lied to her about the eagle,
for his very use of the term "just a bauble"
showed Norton that the backwoodsman had
not known what it was.  No man who was
a member of the Cincinnati but reverenced
the order and all it stood for, and whenever
he thought of those words Norton felt hot
anger thrilling him.
</p>

<p>
Turning to his own situation, he dismissed
the remembrance of Kitty Grigg for
the present.  Had her father overheard their
conversation?  If so, there was a bare
chance of finding trouble waiting near Blue
River.  He saw, however, that she had
suggested the wisest course to him.  Half an
hour later, coming to a fork in the trail, he
promptly turned off to the south.
</p>

<p>
His best plan now lay in finding the man
Red Hugh, of whom Boone had spoken, and
enlisting his services.  There might also be
a messenger at Dodd's Tavern, if Ayres kept
his word.
</p>

<p>
Norton perceived very plainly that he
had been neatly driven out of Louisville as
a fugitive, but he firmly intended to return
otherwise&mdash;for divers reasons.  If he was to
detect the river-pirates or whoever formed
the band of Blacknose, he must do it by
means of scouting along the river.  It might
require weeks and months of arduous work
and woods-living, and such a man as Red
Hugh would prove invaluable.  Were Boone
right in his description of the man who slew
Indians&mdash;and Norton knew of too many
such to doubt&mdash;this Red Hugh would be
more than apt to know all the river-haunts
this side the Mississippi.
</p>

<p>
"After all," he told himself cheerily,
"things seem to have turned out very well!
If Ayres does not forget his promises, we
may yet bring Blacknose to book."
</p>

<p>
He passed one or two scattered cabins
that afternoon, shot a wild turkey, and
camped for the night beside a creek, in
perfect content.  In case Grigg had not
overheard his plan, he decided to let the
man think he had followed the Tennessee
trail; he was not at all sure that Duval
and Grigg were not leagued against him,
and knew better than to trust in the lawyer's
seeming apology.  Kitty's words rang in
his mind&mdash;"If Charles Duval gave you an
apology, look to your steps!"
</p>

<p>
"She knew the breed all right," he
reflected, the next morning.  "I should have
known better myself.  Well, now for the
north and west!"
</p>

<p>
He made no effort to hide his camp.  As
the creek ran north, seemingly to the Ohio,
he led his horse along its bed for a good
mile, picked hard ground for the emergence,
and rode off, leaving a carefully covered
trail.  Even were he followed, his pursuers
would be a day or two later, he knew, so
before noon he flung off all care and rode on
through the woods.
</p>

<p>
Another turkey and a small deer fell to
his rifle that morning, after which he wended
his solitary way in peace, with meat and to
spare.  Stopping at noon, he lighted a small
fire and proceeded to smoke enough of his
fresh meat to last for a few days, as he was
going on to the river, where game was
thinned out.  He had been following no
trail and had seen no one all that morning;
the forest seemed limitless and desolate,
empty of all human life.
</p>

<p>
Norton, however, did not relax his
vigilance.  While he was engaged with his
meat, he paused suddenly, caught up his
rifle, and drew the feather from the
touch-hole.  He heard no sound, but he had a
subtle warning that someone was near;
before he had unstopped his powder-horn,
the bushes opposite were flung aside and two
Indians appeared.
</p>

<p>
"How!"
</p>

<p>
They gazed at him, motionless, with only
the single word of peace, and Norton returned
the stare with interest.  Both men were
dressed in beaded buckskin; both wore
medals and carried Kentucky rifles, and both
were unpainted; the larger man was strikingly
handsome, while the other, who possessed
but one eye, had a wild ferocity in
his features.
</p>

<p>
Without a word more, the larger man
laid his rifle on the ground and made an
inquiring motion toward the meat.  Norton
told them to help themselves, and
endeavoured to make them talk; but neither
would say a thing, save for a swift exchange
of gutturals between themselves.
</p>

<p>
He watched them in no little interest as
they ate, and came to the conclusion that
they were no ordinary warriors.  He knew
little of the northern tribes, but from the
fact that the one-eyed man wore moccasins
of unmistakable Cherokee make, he guessed
the two had been on a trip to the south.
Having none of the Kentuckian's contempt
for the Indian, Norton went on about his
work quietly though watchfully, rather perplexed
by the oddity of their silence.  Pouring
fresh powder into his pan, he set his rifle
ready to hand, whereat he thought the
handsome Indian smiled a little.
</p>

<p>
When they had eaten the better half of
his deer, they both drew out small pipes of
the precious calumet stone&mdash;a thing which
in itself marked them as men of rank.
Norton silently proffered them tobacco.  The
handsome chieftain made the ceremonial of
four puffs and handed his pipe to Norton,
who repeated it, thinking they would now
talk.  In this he was mistaken.  The
one-eyed man emitted a grunt as Norton made
the four puffs in Indian fashion to the four
quarters of the heavens, but that was all.
Although he ventured a question, neither
replied.
</p>

<p>
With that Norton gave a shrug, rose, and
began tying his smoked meat to his saddle.
He wished that he knew more about the
northern redskins, for these were certainly
men of some importance, but his experiences
had been confined to Creek, Cherokee, and
Seminole, while these two were quite clearly
of a different race&mdash;whether Shawnee,
Miami, Wyandot, or Ottawa he could not
tell.
</p>

<p>
As he turned to pick up his rifle, the larger
man rose and came forward, smiling.  He
reached forth an empty powder-horn, which
was finely carved, and indicated by signs
that Norton was to give him powder; it
was not a demand, but a courteous request.
Norton, at first inclined to anger, found
himself suddenly impressed by this unknown
Indian; having plenty of powder himself,
he at length assented and poured a few
charges into the empty horn.
</p>

<p>
At this, the Indian gravely proffered him
a shilling&mdash;and Norton noted that it was
English money.  He was well aware that he
was going through a remarkable experience,
there being little enough money in the
settlements themselves, to say nothing of
Indians using it&mdash;a thing unheard of.
</p>

<p>
"You're welcome," he smiled, waving
back the coin.  "I don't wish payment&mdash;you're
quite welcome, though I don't suppose
an Indian would ever hand me out free
powder."
</p>

<p>
Whether he was understood or not, he
could not tell.  The one-eyed man, still
sitting over his pipe, grunted out something;
the other turned with swift anger in
his face and poured forth a flood of words.
Norton guessed shrewdly that the one-eyed
man had expressed entire willingness to give
him free powder at any time&mdash;from the end
of a rifle.
</p>

<p>
Abruptly, the friendly chief turned to
Norton again, and made signs for the latter
to remove his moccasins&mdash;at the same time
unfastening his own.  Puzzled, the Louisianian
hesitated a moment and finally obeyed,
seeing that the other meant it.  Then the
Indian held out his moccasins&mdash;ankle-high,
and elaborately beaded and quilled.  Norton
drew back, glancing at his own torn and
stained and unbeaded pair, which he had
obtained from a Creek squaw on his way
north.
</p>

<p>
"You mean to exchange with me?" he
asked, wondering.  "No, I can't do that,
man!  Why, those moccasins of yours are
magnificent!  Want to sell them?"
</p>

<p>
A lightning flash of terrible anger shot
into the swarthy features, but was gone
instantly.  Again the Indian nodded and held
out his moccasins.  Understanding that he
was being paid in this fashion for his
hospitality, Norton reluctantly accepted,
amazed that an Indian should even think
of payment.  When he had donned the new
and unusually fine pair of the Indian, he
put out his hand&mdash;and met a smiling refusal
to shake.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Frowning, he turned to his horse and
mounted.  As he rode away, his friend sent
him a wave of the hand; then he splashed
across the shallow creek near his camp, and
the strange pair of redskins were lost behind
him.  It was odd, undoubtedly; that refusal
to shake hands had been a very manly way
of saying they were enemies, yet he knew
there was no Indian war going on at present.
</p>

<p>
Unable to account for the whole experience,
he dismissed it from his mind.  It was one
of the weird silent happenings which the
wilderness holds in store for those who penetrate
her fastnesses; strange things, memories
which remain for ever, yet which may never
react upon the future, the ebb and flow of
Dead Sea tides leaving nothing upon the
shores of life save the brine of wasted energy.
Had John Norton known who his two guests
were, however, he might not have considered
the incident closed, so far as he himself was
concerned.  To them, indeed, it might well
prove a momentary thing.
</p>

<p>
So he dismissed it lightly enough, and
looked ahead.  As he sat by his campfire
that night and considered his situation, he
found it good.  He was to seek a certain
unnamed settlement on the Indian shore,
twelve miles this side of the Blue River, and
on the Kentucky side would find Red Hugh;
then on to Blue River, Dodd's tavern, and
the messenger from Ayres.  That afternoon
he had seen the river hills to the north; so
by keeping due west, getting off early, and
pushing hard, he might find Red Hugh's
cabin by the next night.  He must have come
a good twenty miles, he considered, of the
forty-five lying between Louisville and his
destination, for all that he had taken a
circuitous course.
</p>

<p>
Before sunrise he was up and on his way
again.  Two hours later he drew up on a rising
knoll amid the hills, and saw the signal-fire
of Destiny awaiting him.
</p>

<p>
It was a spiral of blue smoke, ascending
from the valley beyond, and perhaps a mile
away.  Norton sat watching it for a moment;
to his trained eye it showed a fire of green
wood, too small for a careless settler's
building, too large for that of Indian or
backwoodsman.
</p>

<p>
Since his meeting with the two redskins,
Norton had regained his caution.  He knew
that the Kentucky woods were filled with
adventurers and peculiar individuals of all
descriptions, to say nothing of Indians who
might or might not be hostile.  So, having
made certain that there were no settlers'
cabins in the vicinity, he dismounted and
went forward on foot.  His horse, an Indian
pony he had bought at Fort Massac, followed
at a little distance behind him, treading
almost as silently as did Norton himself.
</p>

<p>
After proceeding some distance, he tied
the beast to a tree and went on more cautiously
still, for that fire interested him.  It was
evidently built by someone who feared
nothing in the woods, yet was a stranger to
woods' ways, and Norton thought for a fleeting
instant that he might have chanced upon
the retreat of Blacknose.  With his rifle
ready loaded and primed, he stole forward,
using all his woodcraft.
</p>

<p>
But his all was not enough, it proved.
While he was crossing a thickly overgrown
hollow, he flushed up two cardinals from
a canebrake just ahead, and as the birds
went up Norton realized that his cunning
had been in vain.  He was just about to
plunge into the high canebrake when the
tall yellowish stalks were brushed aside to
disclose a figure of nearly his own height, and
a white man stepped forth.
</p>

<p>
For a moment the two men stared at each
other in mutual surprise and admiration,
for both were striking in looks&mdash;Norton in
his capable, alert, piercing-eyed way, the
stranger in sheer manly beauty.  He was
an inch shorter than Norton, was this stranger
who had risen from the midst of the cane;
the effeminacy of the long hair curling over
his shoulders was at once offset by a strong
nose, large mouth, and square chin, and very
large, deep-set, commanding dark eyes.
</p>

<p>
Norton was startled by the appearance of
this man, who seemed not of the woods and
yet a woodsman.  He wore a magnificent
ruffled shirt of finest French linen, flung open
at the throat to display a neck as bronzed as
Norton's own; his coat and knee-breeches
were of black satin, his knee-high moccasins
of rude home make; a watch fob-ribbon
hung on one side of his belt, a powder-horn
and hunting-knife opposite.  Over one ear
was stuck a long crayon, while in his hand
he held a thin board with paper fastened to it.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Parbleu</i>!" exclaimed the stranger, then
continued instantly in excellent English,
staring hard at Norton: "Your coming was
most unfortunate, sir!  You frightened away
the finest specimen of Kentucky cardinal
I have seen this year!"
</p>

<p>
"Accept my apologies, monsieur," smiled
Norton, speaking in French.  "You are
a Frenchman, then?"
</p>

<p>
"I?  Not at all!" cried the other.  "I was
born in Louisiana, removing later to France,
but this is my country.  Who are you, sir,
who speak French so excellently in this
wilderness?  Do you come from the French
Grant up-river?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I gained that language in New
Orleans," returned Norton, wondering greatly
who this eccentric stranger might be.  "I
regret having frightened away your bird&mdash;I
trust you did not anticipate dining upon
him?"
</p>

<p>
The other looked bewildered.
</p>

<p>
"Eh?  Dining?  Do you eat such birds, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Heavens, no!"  And Norton laughed
despite himself.  "But what else could you
want of him?"
</p>

<p>
The stranger broke into a frank laughter;
so winning and direct was his whole attitude
that the puzzled Norton felt an odd
liking for the man.
</p>

<p>
"It seems we were both mistaken then!
I was limning the bird&mdash;but come to the
higher ground in here.  Did you ever see
a cardinal's nest?"
</p>

<p>
"I never looked for one," returned Norton
curtly.  He followed to a small patch of
drier ground in the centre of the cane-brake,
and the stranger eagerly pointed to
a nest in the branches of a young cottonwood,
to one side.
</p>

<p>
"Sit down&mdash;stay quiet!" commanded the
other quickly.  "They will return in a
half-hour, sir&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Then I'll be on my way," broke in
Norton drily, "for I have other business
than watching birds, sir."
</p>

<p>
He turned, when the stranger set down
the paper and board, on which only a few
sketchy lines were visible, and caught at
his arm.
</p>

<p>
"Pardon, sir&mdash;one moment!  Are you lately
from Louisiana?  Do you know that country
well?"
</p>

<p>
"I've lived there all my life, practically,"
said Norton.  "Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Well"&mdash;and the other seemed to forget
his birds temporarily&mdash;"I was but a child
when I went to France, and last year I
heard a monstrous strange story of Upper
Louisiana, which I have never been able
to authenticate.  I met one of the men who
had been on Colonel Burr's ill-fated expedition,
and he assured me that on the banks
of the Missouri there is a mountain of
salt&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Travellers' tales," laughed Norton, but
the other continued quickly:
</p>

<p>
"Wait, sir!  He also stated very decidedly
that had Colonel Burr succeeded in his
venture, he would have been joined by a
great tribe of Indians.  This tribe inhabit
a country of some nine hundred square miles,
around the salt mountain, fight always on
horseback, and are armed with the short
Spanish carbines&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"My dear sir," inquired Norton in frank
wonder, "are you in earnest?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course I am!" And indeed there
was no mistaking the eager interest of the
stranger's handsome face.  "I am a student
of ornithology, sir&mdash;that is, I pursue the
study in my spare time&mdash;but I am also keenly
interested in such matters of ethnology, and
if you could enlighten me as to this Indian
tribe, I would appreciate it.  You seem a
person of no little refinement and culture&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," laughed Norton heartily.
"Well, sir, I can assure you that this tale
is a myth in all its branches, is not worthy of
credence, and your informant was wholly
wrong.  I trust that is sweeping enough.
Now, as I am in some haste, I will leave you
to your birds and pursue my way.  Do
you know how far I am from the Blue
River?"
</p>

<p>
"I do not, sir"&mdash;and the frank eyes
twinkled at him.  "I have been in camp
here for a week past, watching this pair of
birds at work.  Fortunately my sketches
are completed, but my provisions are gone,
and I have lost my spare flints and cannot
shoot.  How say you&mdash;shall we seek the
Blue River together, sir, and become gentleman
adventurers through the wilderness?"
</p>

<p>
Something in the merry, careless, wholly
engaging manner of this man made the
Louisianian warm toward him.  He could
not mistrust that frank, sturdy, piercing-eyed
face; here was a man in whom there
was no guile, and almost involuntarily
Norton struck his hand into that of the
other.
</p>

<p>
"Done!" he laughed happily.  "By
thunder, sir.  I like you!  Hold on, though."  He
paused in dismay as a sudden thought
struck him.  "I must refuse your company,
sir, for your own good.  I am in some
danger, and if you travelled with me it
might turn out badly all around."
</p>

<p>
"Danger?"  And when the other frowned
Norton discovered a strange quality of power
in the strong face.  "Do not tell me you
are a criminal."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not."  Norton hesitated, in some
embarrassment.  Another steady look from
the deep-set eyes of the stranger, and he
concluded suddenly to open his heart to
this man, to whom he felt so greatly drawn.
"Frankly, sir, I am in Kentucky for the
purpose of rooting out a gang of river pirates
known as Blacknose's gang.  Their organization
has discovered my purpose, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, is that all!"  And the other laughed,
passed his arm through Norton's, and gently
urged him through the canes ahead.  "Nonsense,
friend!  <i>En avant</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"I guess you don't know much about that
gang," grunted Norton.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I ought to," retorted the other
drily.  "Last year I lost a dozen hogsheads
of the finest tobacco, some prime ginseng
cured in Canton fashion, and a good load of
flax!  I know them, and appreciate your
danger.  I am with you, sir, and with all
my heart&mdash;there's the hand of John Audubon
on it!"
</p>

<p>
"Audubon!" repeated Norton, his eyes
kindling.  "Why, I met your partner at
Louisville&mdash;"  He halted abruptly.
</p>

<p>
"And I'll wager that Rosier told you I
was touched in the head, eh?"  Audubon
broke into a peal of ringing laughter.  "Every
man to his trade!  Rosier cannot understand
why I will not settle down behind the counter
and make money.  Nay, but I cannot!  Now
come along&mdash;here is my camp."
</p>

<p>
Norton followed into a small glade of
cottonwoods, where a horse grazed beside
a rudely erected brush shelter.  He remembered
that Rosier had said his partner was
touched in the head, but he did not need to
remember what else Rosier had said.  He
knew already that he could trust John
Audubon&mdash;in fact, he felt that he could more
than trust him.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
</h3>

<p>
Within an hour the two men had become
firm friends.  They were alike only in the
saving grace of humour, for Audubon had
been trained in a gentler school than Norton.
The latter was amazed to find that his new
comrade, as Rosier had said, left his family
and business at Louisville, in order to spend
weeks in the woods; yet when Norton saw
the drawings and sketches of birds which
Audubon proudly displayed, he was forced
to confess that the long weeks had borne
fruit.
</p>

<p>
"I can't see what use they are, except
to science," he said ruefully, "but I presume
you get out of them the same keen satisfaction
that I get out of a trail well blazed or
a hunt well finished."
</p>

<p>
"Exactly," laughed the other.  "But
enough of this.  Tell me about Blacknose."
</p>

<p>
Norton did so, relating all that had
happened to him since his eventful arrival
at the Taylor farm.  Audubon listened in
keen interest, stroking his long powerful
chin but saying nothing.  When Norton
had made an end, the naturalist&mdash;for this,
and not shopkeeping, was his real
profession&mdash;quietly bundled up his drawings in a
portfolio.  He arranged them neatly and
in precision, and not until he had buckled the
last buckle did he break the silence which
had fallen.  Then his eyes clenched on the
keen sword-gaze of Norton, and he smiled.
</p>

<p>
"I will go with you.  My wife is with
General Clark, and need fear nothing; I
myself am accounted as a little crazed, so
no man would hurt me.  But let them
wait!  The day is coming when this country
of ours shall take her rightful place among
the nations who sit at the feet of science!
Look at our bison and elk, our countless new
species of every bird and animal&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He broke off suddenly, laughed at his own
hot enthusiasm, and continued.
</p>

<p>
"But, sir, your pardon.  You are a soldier,
and I am not&mdash;but in truth I have served
in the navy of France, so let us demolish
these river pirates together.  Poor Rosier
would scarce credit me joining you, I fear!"
</p>

<p>
Norton smiled.  He liked this animated,
vivacious, strong young fellow immensely,
and was far too well educated to share in the
prejudices of the Kentuckians against him.
Audubon had been in Louisville only a few
months, his life having alternated between
France and America, but his business venture
with Rosier had been sadly crippled by the
activity of the river pirates, and also by his
own indifference.  He did not lack energy
for any pursuit which attracted him, however,
and flung himself into Norton's problem
with a whole-hearted enthusiasm which
delighted the Louisianian.
</p>

<p>
The latter went over each point, from the
description of the would-be assassin to his
last meeting with Duval and Grigg.  On this
last, Audubon managed to throw some faint
light.
</p>

<p>
"Grigg was accused of horse-theft this
spring," he said thoughtfully.  "He was
even had up in court, but Duval defended
him most ably, and had him acquitted.
I have often seen them together, too.  This
fellow Duval is a most able lawyer, Norton;
he is said to be a second Hercules in strength,
and seems to have plenty of money.  So you
met the famous Colonel Boone, eh?  I hope
for that pleasure some day; he is a famous
man, a famous man!"
</p>

<p>
Norton tried to elicit some information
about the two mysterious Indians whom he
had met, but Audubon merely shook his
head, knowing nothing of the redskins and
caring less.
</p>

<p>
"As to this river piracy, one of our
merchants, a Mr. Tarascon, last year tried
to capture the men.  His hogsheads of
tobacco were privately marked in a certain
place, and after losing two cargoes he had all
the river captains watching for them.  One
Captain Brookfield, who runs a horse-power
barque of forty tons, stated later that he had
received a number of hogsheads from a
settler at Blue River.  He believed them to
be the ones in question, but the private mark
had been branded over very cleverly.  So that
plan came to nothing."
</p>

<p>
"At least," exclaimed Norton eagerly,
"it would go to show that the Tarascon
boats were looted between Louisville and Blue
River, eh?  Of course, others have vanished
at different points; a band of pirates with
confederates on the boats would not be so
foolish as to commit all their piracies at one
spot, especially after what happened to
the Mason and Harpe gang through just
such work.  Well, I believe we can do no
better than to seek this man, Red Hugh&mdash;if
indeed you are willing to incur the risk of
helping me."
</p>

<p>
"Do you wish me?"  Audubon looked at him
calmly.  "I do not want to intrude&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Why man," and Norton laughed in
sheer happiness until his brown face lost all
its cold grimness and expressed only eager
delight&mdash;"when I left Louisville I wished
that one of two men were with me&mdash;one of
them Daniel Boone, the other a younger
frontiersman named Crockett, whom I know
well.  Now I extend that to a third, and the
third is named Audubon; I think, perhaps,
that I would sooner have this same
Mr. Audubon than either of the other two!
You are a man, sir."
</p>

<p>
Audubon put out his hand, and Norton
gripped it, eye to eye.
</p>

<p>
"And you," returned the other slowly,
"are&mdash;well, that compliment gains its whole
value, sir, in coming from you.  I can say
no more."
</p>

<p>
It was enough, and with a song in his heart
Norton returned to get his horse, while
Audubon gathered his scattered belongings
and made ready to depart.  The bird-lover had
a small double-barrelled rifle which he had
bought in Philadelphia some years before,
and when he had replenished his stock of
ammunition from Norton's store, the two set
forth.
</p>

<p>
They were a strange pair&mdash;Audubon in
his black satin and French shirt, Norton
in his buckskin and magnificent moccasins.
Both were well versed in threading wilderness
pathways, however, and it was no great
task to find the Ohio.  Late that afternoon
they pushed their horses to the brow of a
small hill, and saw the great river lying
before them.  The hills, which drew close
to the Ohio at Blue River, were some
distance back from the banks at this point,
dense patches of canebrake appearing along
the lower ground.  The summer heat had
thoroughly dried out the canes, and at sight
of the yellow-brown patches Norton nodded.
</p>

<p>
"I rode along the Indiana shore from Fort
Massac to Louisville," he said, "and remember
seeing these canebrakes from across the
river.  We're almost opposite a little
settlement called Doe Run&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," added the other quickly, "and
we are some eight miles from the spot
indicated to you by Boone.  I went down-river
to Henderson last month and remember
seeing that rocky cliff on the Indiana shore.
What think you&mdash;shall we press on and find
your Red Hugh to-night, or wait till
morning?"
</p>

<p>
Norton decided to camp where they were.
The afternoon was far gone; there were no
settlements on the Kentucky shore, and
they would stand little chance of finding
Red Hugh's cabin at night.  So he went on
with the horses, while Audubon went after
meat; by the time Norton had made camp
on a small hillock of dry ground among the
canebrakes, his companion came in with a
wild turkey and news that a storm seemed
coming up from the south.
</p>

<p>
When darkness came down and their
bird was cooking, Audubon's prediction was
justified by a shrill whispering of the canes
as the wind stirred them.  A brush shelter
was soon thrown up, however, and the two
men settled down in comfort, regardless of
the weather.
</p>

<p>
Norton found that his companion agreed
with him on the course to be pursued.
Leaving Ayres out of the case, they could
do nothing but scout along the river shores,
and with the help of Red Hugh might hope
to accomplish something.  This settled, the
horses were picketed and Norton fell asleep
to the rustling of the canes and the soughing
of the wind in the cot ton woods.
</p>

<p>
He wakened once, to find the fire burned
out, the sky overcast, and a stiff gale
sweeping over the valley.  No rain had fallen,
however, and despite the uneasy feeling
that should have warned him, Norton slept
once more.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
When he was roused again, it was by a
shrill scream from a horse, followed almost
instantly by a rush of feet and a volley of
shots.  Norton was on his feet at once, with
a shout to his companion; Audubon was
already up, however, as his voice testified.
</p>

<p>
"The cane's afire, Norton!  A spark must
have caught it&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Sparks don't fly against the wind,"
grunted Norton.
</p>

<p>
They stood silent, dismayed by the
spectacle around them and by the truth of
Norton's remark.  Dawn had come up; the high
wind from the south was still blowing, and
the canebrake was afire along the edge of the
higher ground behind them.  The two horses
had disappeared, frightened by the veil of
smoke drifting over the camp.
</p>

<p>
"Had the canes been afire along the river
below," went on Norton grimly, "we
could lay it to our own fire.  But this
seems to me the work of other hands,
Audubon.  The canes have been fired at a
dozen places&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Then we had best lose no time getting
out of here," cried the other.  "Hello!
Where's my rifle?"
</p>

<p>
"Gone, with mine," Norton grunted
angrily as he realized what had occurred.
"The enemy has trapped us and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What?  You mean&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Blacknose," nodded Norton, pale to the
lips.  "No use trying to break through that
line of fire, because we're hemmed in all
round."
</p>

<p>
Audubon stared blankly at him, cursed,
then turned his eyes to the fire-sweep.  Both
men were quite well aware of their position.
An enemy had removed their rifles and freed
their horses, and the fire would do the rest.
</p>

<p>
The thirty-foot canes were blazing fiercely,
the drifted smoke and flames completely
cutting off all egress by the neck of higher
ground through which the two had entered
toward the shore.  As the fire took hold, the
explosions of water in the cane-joints became
continuous; so loud were they that Norton
could not but imagine himself in the midst
of a battle.  Audubon stared at the
spectacle, awe-struck, for the flames and smoke
were rising high; he already held his precious
portfolio, seeming to care for nothing else.
</p>

<p>
The two men were soon aroused to their
danger, however.  Across the little opening
on which they stood slipped an immense
rattlesnake, followed quickly by a rush of
rabbits; from one side came a tremendous
crashing amid the canes, and by the lurid
glare which paled the growing daylight,
Norton made out the form of a bear crushing
his way in panic toward the river.
</p>

<p>
"Come on," he cried hastily, turning.
"Our only hope is the river, Audubon!
If we can splash through the shallows beyond
the edge of the fire, we'll be safe."
</p>

<p>
"Lead the way, then," returned the other
calmly.  "Good God, what a sight!"
</p>

<p>
His leathern shirt already hot against
his skin, Norton turned and plunged to
where the bear was still crashing through the
canes.  The river was a hundred yards away,
and so thick were the high canes that to
force a passage was impossible; their only
hope lay in following the course of the
frightened bear.  With hot anger raging in him
against the fiends who had laid this trap, and
with quick realization that Audubon's shot
at the turkey the previous evening must
have drawn their foes upon them, Norton
dashed forward into the muck.
</p>

<p>
It was high time, for the nearer canes
were already being fired by sparks.  On
every side the explosions were crashing out
while small animals scurried past in blind
panic.  A moment later the two friends
gained the shore, however, and as they did
so a canoe appeared a dozen feet away,
paddled by a single man.
</p>

<p>
"Help!" cried Norton eagerly.  "Come
in here and get us off, friend!"
</p>

<p>
The canoe was drifting slowly, and even
as the two plunged out into the shallow
water, they were halted abruptly.  The high
brake around them shut out the glare from
behind, and by the rapidly increasingly
daylight they saw that the single occupant
of the canoe was covering them with a rifle.
</p>

<p>
"Hold on, thar!" he cried hoarsely.  "This
gun's primed!"
</p>

<p>
And Norton recognized Audubon's double-barrelled
rifle.  There was now no doubt as
to the identity of the canoeist&mdash;it was he
who had thieved their rifles and set the
cane-brake afire.
</p>

<p>
"You'll pay for this work," exclaimed
Norton, trying to repress his rage.  His
hand went to his belt.  Audubon, also
realizing at once who the man was, took a
forward step.
</p>

<p>
"Come on, Norton&mdash;wade around the brake&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Stop!"  The man in the canoe levelled
the rifle full at them; he was barely three
yards away, and an eddy of the stream
floated the canoe around.  "You-all ain't
in no danger.  This here's a warnin' to git.
They's a flatboat comin' around the bend&mdash;swim
out an' git took off; stay on her
clar to Saint Looey, an' keep out o' this
country, you"&mdash;and Norton perceived that
the remarks were addressed to him.
</p>

<p>
He also perceived something else.  The
man was holding the rifle at his left shoulder;
he was bearded, wore a buckskin coat and
a cap of fox, with the brush hanging over
his back.  Norton started suddenly.  He
had no need to see powder-horn or moccasins.
</p>

<p>
"So you're completing your work, eh?"
he cried savagely.  "You're the man who
shot at me on the Beargrass Creek road the
other day, eh?"
</p>

<p>
The villainous face of the man contracted.
</p>

<p>
"Ain't no 'lasses sticking to your feet, is
they?" he jeered.  "Right ye are, pardner.
Now, you-all git aboard that flatboat an'
stay thar, see?"
</p>

<p>
Norton thought swiftly, his hand closing
on the hatchet in his belt.  This was one of
the Blacknose gang, beyond a doubt, and was
the man whom Ayres had seen talking with
Duval.  Was it possible that&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Who hired you for this dirty work?" he
demanded swiftly.  "Tell me who Blacknose
is, and I'll give you five hundred dollars&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Git out an' swim, ye cussed spy," snarled
the man evilly.  "I ain't goin' to miss ye
next time&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Norton, who had drawn his hand behind
him, flicked forward his wrist in an
underhand throw, having no chance to raise the
tomahawk.  Even as the steel flamed out,
the man caught the motion and fired; Norton
flung himself forward, felt a hot sear of pain
across his head, and plunged bodily on the
canoe.
</p>

<p>
It was a desperate expedient, but Norton
was too hot with anger to care for possibilities.
Before the man could fire his second
barrel, Norton's weight sent the canoe over
backward; he went with it, felt himself
grappled, and had a brief glimpse of Audubon
leaping at the canoe as he went under.
</p>

<p>
The water was little more than knee-deep,
but Norton felt something sting at
his shoulder and knew his opponent had a
knife out.  Smashing down with his fist
through the smother, he tried to free himself
of the hand at his throat, but vainly.  Already
wounded, he felt a terrible weakness
stealing over him, and the water choked his
lungs.  His fingers closed on a wrist, and he
gripped it desperately as he struggled up
to get his head above the water.
</p>

<p>
In this he succeeded, pulling his opponent
with him, and for a moment the two men
stood breast to breast.  The riverman fought
with an appalling savagery, snarling like
a beast, and Norton knew his case was
desperate.  Blood blinded him: the hand about
his throat drew tighter; and with only his
right hand holding off the menacing knife,
he put down his left hand to his belt in a
last desperate effort.
</p>

<p>
The other saw his object, but could not
prevent it without loosing his hold on
Norton's throat.  Snarling again, he threw
himself forward; Norton was not braced
against the move, and went over backward
into the water.  It was life or death now,
and the Louisianian knew it.  Jerking his
own knife free, he lashed out frantically.
The blade drove home, but he pulled it free
and struck, again and again.
</p>

<p>
Wounded, throttled, choked with mud
and water, Norton felt himself loosed from
that terrible death-grapple.  He tried weakly
to lift himself erect, but could only raise
his head from the water, sobbing in the
smoke-laden air, while burning cane-flakes
fell all around.  He could see nothing,
but felt hands lifting him and heard the
voice of Audubon in his ear.  The words
sounded faint and very far away.
</p>

<p>
Norton was by no means unconscious,
but he was weak and nauseated and
half-drowned.  He was well assured that never
again would he have to seek a left-handed
man with red-streaked powder-horn.  He
needed no glimpse of the horror-struck visage
of Audubon to tell him that their enemy
would fire no more canebrakes.
</p>

<p>
He felt Audubon bundle him over the
side of the canoe, with much difficulty,
but was too weak to offer any assistance.
Then Audubon himself climbed aboard and
began to paddle the craft out into the river.
Norton lay in the grip of a deadly coma
until a burning flake settled on his back
and aroused him as it ate through his leather
shirt.  He rolled over, quenched the burning
in the water that half-filled the canoe, and
sat up.
</p>

<p>
Clutching at the gunnels, he stared about.
Behind was the roaring mass of flame which
had so nearly swallowed them, and they
were already in the swift current of the
stream.  The river made a sharp bend just
above them, toward which the smoke was
drifting; they had already swept out of
the murk, and Norton saw a flatboat
floating down-river, half a mile away.
</p>

<p>
Setting his teeth against the giddiness
swirling over him, he reached down and
grasped a paddle.  At his feet were the
rifles; Audubon must have recovered them,
then.  As he got his paddle over the side,
Audubon looked around with a ghastly
smile.
</p>

<p>
"All right, Norton?"
</p>

<p>
"Right enough.  Keep her going."
</p>

<p>
Little by little he conquered himself.  He
was very weak, but as they neared the
flatboat he managed to wave his paddle.  The
crew of the boat were lined up with rifles,
but as Audubon stood up, at some risk to
the canoe, they recognized his figure and
got out their sweeps.  Five minutes later
they were alongside, and Norton fainted.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
</h3>

<p>
Sitting on a big tobacco hogshead and
watching the Indiana shore, with Audubon
standing gloomily at his side, Norton felt
his bandaged head tenderly and considered
what was to be done.
</p>

<p>
"I saved the canoe from going under,"
said Audubon, "then rescued the rifles.  I
could give you no help until I saw your
head come up.  By the way, this was in
the canoe."
</p>

<p>
He held out a powder-horn&mdash;mottled,
with a streak of red running through it.
Norton stared down at it, then with a grim
laugh reached into the coat which hung in
the sun with his other clothes, and drew
out the stopper Boone had found on the
Beargrass Creek road that morning.  The
plug slipped deftly into place; the horn
matched perfectly.
</p>

<p>
"Well, so much for an assassin," he said
grimly.  "Now that you've had your initial
taste of the work our foemen do, have you
lost taste for the enterprise?"
</p>

<p>
"Not unless the enterprise has lost taste
for me," laughed Audubon, with a glance
around.  The crew of the flatboat were
safe out of hearing.  "I told our friends
here that we had set fire to the canes
ourselves, by accident&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Good.  Am I badly hurt?  Where are we?"
</p>

<p>
"You should have care; the bullet scraped
along your skull, and you have a knife-gash
in the side.  We have just passed Buck
Creek, and the rocky cliff for which we
were making lies about three miles
downstream.  Best let Red Hugh pass, go to
the Blue River settlement, and wait there
until you are recovered."
</p>

<p>
Norton made no other reply than to reach
for his half-dried clothes.  The other looked
at him, his fine face wrinkled into a frown
of anxiety.
</p>

<p>
"It's rank madness, Norton!" he said
quietly.  "You're scarce able to walk, and
are like to suffer&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I am going to find Red Hugh, if I die
the next hour."
</p>

<p>
Norton finished drawing on the fine-beaded
moccasins, slipped the red-streaked horn
over his shoulder by its thong, and looked
at his comrade.  He felt shaky indeed, but
so clearly did his whole manner evince the
iron determination within him, that Audubon
shook his head resignedly and turned to his
own garments.
</p>

<p>
"The canoe is towing astern," he said
simply.
</p>

<p>
Norton reached for his buckskin shirt,
and staggered under a swirl of pain and
weakness.  Instantly the other was at his
side, with a rush of protestation against
trying to leave the hospitable flatboat.
</p>

<p>
"I am going to find Red Hugh," said
Norton doggedly, and resumed his dressing
as his head cleared.
</p>

<p>
They were slipping down the stream fast.
Already the high cliff mentioned by Boone
as a landmark was in sight, far ahead, and
Audubon departed to find the captain.  The
latter readily assented to take the
flatboat in close to the Kentucky shore, and
sent his crew to the sweeps.  The boat was
going through to St. Louis, and her captain
carried some freight for Audubon, so that
the latter met with prompt obedience.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Norton sat in the sun and
wiped the wet rifles mechanically.  Every
trace of the storm had vanished and the
morning was coming up splendid in summer
warmth.  Norton knew they were in a grave
situation, however, and said as much when
his comrade rejoined him.
</p>

<p>
The man whose canoe they now held had
undoubtedly been one of the Blacknose gang,
and Norton strongly believed he had been
one of a cordon of spies stretched at intervals
along the river.  Were this the case, the
conflagration would be noticed, the man's
body might be found, and the gang would
waste no more warnings.  Norton's one hope
lay in getting ashore unobserved,
pre-supposing the river to be watched; if the
flatboat ran in close to the wooded Kentucky
shore, he and Audubon might land
unobserved by anyone who watched from a
distance.  The river seemed deserted, save
for the distantly smoking canebrake far
behind.  Whether there were any Blacknose
spies aboard the flatboat could not be told.
</p>

<p>
So, with fresh ammunition and weapons
and with rifles well-oiled, Norton and
Audubon stood in the bow as the ungainly
flatboat swept into an eddy and approached
the well-wooded bank.  On the opposite
shore, the rocky cliff with its cabin below
was still a trifle down-stream; above them
rose a bluff, a solid mass of virgin timber
that stretched through to Tennessee with
cabins scattered in its depths.  Save at
Henderson and Louisville, the Kentucky
shore was poorly settled as yet, Shawnee
raids from the Wabash having discouraged
too ambitious families.
</p>

<p>
The boat swept in to the bank, almost
underneath a huge cottonwood, and with a
hasty farewell to the river-captain, the two
men leaped ashore and lost no time in
reaching the summit of the bluff.
</p>

<p>
It was a harder task than it looked,
however, and a good twenty minutes had
passed when at length the two panting
men gained the crest of the bluff and paused
to rest.  Norton knew he was in bad shape
and conjectured that malaria had touched
him, for the uncleared lands along the Ohio
were notorious in this respect.  With all
his stubborn will set upon reaching Red
Hugh, he tightened his lips and said nothing
to Audubon of his reeling senses and
disordered vision.
</p>

<p>
The flatboat was already far on her way
to Henderson, once more hugging the Indiana
shore.  Norton motioned Audubon to lead
the way, and in five minutes they struck
upon a faint trail which ran along the
crest of the bluffs.
</p>

<p>
"Well, the Indians had their uses after
all," sighed Audubon, as they came upon
it.  "Whew!  That was a stiff climb, Norton!
Now where is this blazed tree of yours?"
</p>

<p>
Norton collected himself into coherency.
</p>

<p>
"Directly opposite that cliff on the Indiana
shore&mdash;a big cottonwood, blazed north and
south.  We head straight south from it to
reach Red Hugh's cabin."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we're not opposite that cliff yet.
Come along!"
</p>

<p>
The trail ascended the bluff-crest toward
a knoll which topped it.  Norton caught
himself staggering more than once; his
wounds throbbed and ached, and his brain
seemed on fire.  None the less, he knew
he was in no mortal danger, and was filled
with a grim satisfaction over the events of
that morning.
</p>

<p>
"There's no telling how many rivermen
that fellow has murdered," he thought to
himself, "and he tried his bloody work once
too often.  So that's one snake out of our
path!  If the current only swept his body
away, our friend Blacknose will be in a
pretty wonder as to what became of him."
</p>

<p>
The trail was steeper now, and he
clambered up painfully after Audubon.  At
last, fearing lest his senses slip away
altogether, he sank down on a huge root.
</p>

<p>
"Do you look for the tree," he said as the
other turned.  "I must rest a moment."
</p>

<p>
With an anxious glance at his white face,
Audubon nodded and broke into the trees,
for they were already on the knoll.  Norton
leaned back, faint and giddy, and as his
eyes fell on the trail he noted idly that it
was hard rocky soil, indented with the
unmistakable marks of horseshoes.  In his
present state of mind this conveyed nothing
to him; a settler might have passed along
by the trail, or any wandering pedlar
might have made the tracks.
</p>

<p>
He leaned back and closed his eyes,
utterly relaxing himself and grateful for the
brief rest.  He seemed to ache all over, and
for almost the first time in His life his whole
body seemed wearied and fatigued.  A strange
lassitude had come over him.
</p>

<p>
"Norton!"
</p>

<p>
At the excited whisper he opened his eyes
and sat up, to see Audubon peering through
the bushes, finger on lip.  The other beckoned
hastily.
</p>

<p>
"Come in here!  Be cautious."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Already refreshed by his rest, Norton
crept into the bushes.  Audubon's excited
eagerness put him on the alert at once, and
he stole after the other with all the silent
care of an Indian.  Reaching a densely
overgrown covert, Audubon paused and held
up a hand, listening.  From above there
came a low trilling bird-song, but Norton
could make out nothing else.
</p>

<p>
"What is it, man?  What did you find?"
</p>

<p>
"Listen!" whispered Audubon softly.
"Isn't it like a goldfinch singing under its
breath?  The same little trills, the same
sustained sweet notes in between&mdash;but it's a
vireo, Norton!  Would you guess it?"
</p>

<p>
Norton stared, but his friend was in
deadly earnest.  He heard the hidden bird
change its song suddenly, and Audubon
gripped his arm hard.
</p>

<p>
"There&mdash;that's the real vireo song, with
the pulse-like, clear-cut notes!  Did you
ever hear such a thing before?  That bird
was giving a real goldfinch trill, man&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Where's the cottonwood?" broke in
Norton drily.  The other looked at him, his
face blank on a sudden.
</p>

<p>
"Why&mdash;why&mdash;I clear forgot&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Norton laughed, but Audubon suddenly
gripped his arm harder.  The bird above
had broken off in mid-song, for no apparent
reason.  From somewhere outside the covert
came the rattle of a stone, followed by a
horse's snort.
</p>

<p>
"Keep quiet," breathed Norton, looking
into the deep eyes of his friend.  "Someone's
on the trail."
</p>

<p>
Audubon nodded, and the two men stood
tense and motionless, every nerve on edge.
With startling abruptness there came a deep
curse from the trail.
</p>

<p>
"Damn it, pull up!  I ain't no Injun!"
</p>

<p>
There followed a chuckle in another voice&mdash;one
that sent Norton's hand to his rifle.
</p>

<p>
"Winded, Abel?  Well, there's no haste.
What did that boat put in for?"
</p>

<p>
"How'n tarnation do I know?" growled
the first.  "Wa'n't none o' our boys on
her."
</p>

<p>
"So much the better for her, then,"
laughed the second.  "It's odd we didn't
meet Tobin, Abel!"
</p>

<p>
A grunt replied.  Norton glanced at his
friend, his brown eyes aflame.
</p>

<p>
"Duval," he murmured under his breath.
"Who's the other?  Abel Grigg?"
</p>

<p>
Audubon nodded quickly, and his face
was set in eager surmise.
</p>

<p>
"Is Tobin the man we&mdash;we met this
morning, Norton?"
</p>

<p>
Norton pursed up his lips in a silent
whistle, staring.  Was the thing possible
after all?  He had vaguely suspected it
before, yet it seemed incredible.  He replied
to the question with a mute shake of the
head, as Duval's voice continued.  It seemed
that Duval and Grigg were pausing for
breath on the trail opposite the covert.
</p>

<p>
"Listen here, Abel: this thing has to be
finished up sharp, or that fool is apt to
blunder on something that'll bring the
Regulators down on us."  Duval's voice
was earnest, cold, menacing.  "He got away
from the boys at Louisville, and unless
Tobin has met him and is attending to him,
you'll have to do the work.  I'll be busy
in court at Henderson for a week to come."
</p>

<p>
"I'll 'tend to him," growled Grigg.  "How
'bout layin' fer that cargo comin' down
nex' month in Cap. Brookfield's hoss-boat?
We could ship a couple o' the boys on her
an' do the business by them islands at the
Wabash."
</p>

<p>
"Not so bad," returned Duval.  "Lay it
to a bunch of Shawnees, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure.  That feller Tecumsey and his
brother, the Prophet, is raisin' hell all
through the tribes, Duval, an' they's goin'
to be a blow-up mighty sudden on the
border.  Now looky here.  If you're a-goin'
on to Henderson, I'll leave ye here an' go
to meet the boys, so I want to settle this
business of ourn.  How much you goin' to
turn over fer the gal, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"I've told you before, Abel, that I'll
give you five hundred cash and what
stuff we've got in the cache.  Take it or
leave it."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that 'baccy in the cache will
fetch about two hundred at Saint Looey,
eh?  Then we got that flax out o' the last
boat, an' them ten kegs o' 'lasses&mdash;all
right.  You see to makin' out the papers
an' I'll sign 'em.  The gal won't consent,
mebbe, but I'll swear she ain't of age.  You
got to have a preacher weddin', though."
</p>

<p>
"Of course, you fool!"  And there was
an exasperated note in Duval's voice.
"Haven't I said I wanted to marry her?
But you've got to clear out, understand&mdash;go
to New Orleans or Saint Louis, I don't
care which, and stay."
</p>

<p>
"I'll do that, all right.  Well, see ye
at Henderson."
</p>

<p>
"Take care of that spy, mind!" called
Duval.  Only silence ensued.  Then came
a faint thud of hoofs, and again silence.
</p>

<p>
Norton and Audubon stared at each other.
The former had forgotten his illness in his
high excitement, for now he knew beyond
a doubt that fate had given over his enemy
into his hand.
</p>

<p>
"By thunder!" he ejaculated slowly.
"Audubon, we've got the whole game on
the table before us!  The mysterious Blacknose
is Abel Grigg, and Duval is in league
with him&mdash;is probably the brains of the
organization.  The black-hearted scoundrel!
When we tell what we've just heard now&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Who'll believe us?" broke in Audubon
gravely, and shook his head.  "It won't
do, Norton!  Duval is too prominent a man
to be smashed without clear evidence.
Besides, we wouldn't break up the gang
by nabbing him and Grigg alone.  Depend
upon it, we could do little against that
clever villain without more evidence than
those words.  But what a blackguard he
is&mdash;to be robbing his own townsmen!"
</p>

<p>
"And that girl&mdash;Grigg's daughter!" broke
in Norton, a flame of rage sweeping through
him.  "Did you hear them?  He's buying
the girl, Audubon&mdash;buying her!  Damn it,
man, did you ever see that girl?"
</p>

<p>
Audubon gazed at him, astonished at the
outburst.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he replied slowly, "I've seen her
once or twice in the store.  Do you think
that's really what they meant?  Why, it
can't be possible, Norton!"
</p>

<p>
None the less, Norton knew that the
thing was true.  He drew a deep breath as
the full realization of his triumph broke
over his mind.  By a stroke of sheer luck
he had solved the mystery of Blacknose&mdash;but
was it luck?  Had not one thing led
to another in marvellous sequence&mdash;the
cane-brake, the fire, the flatboat, the landing,
and finally the vireo singing the song of a
goldfinch?  Surely, there was more than
luck in all this!
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
A new burst of rage came into his heart
at thought of Kitty Grigg, however.  So
this evil-hoary old backwoodsman who was
not her father was planning to sell her to
Duval!  Norton inwardly vowed that such
a sale should never be consummated.  He
remembered the girl as he had last seen her
by the cabin, glorious in her unstained
beauty and her fine clear poise&mdash;and groaned.
With a sudden movement he reached inside
his shirt and took out the little gold eagle
still pinned to it.
</p>

<p>
"Audubon," he cried earnestly, "I swear
by this emblem, which stands for the things
I hold dearest&mdash;my country, and my father's
memory&mdash;that before Duval carries through
his purpose regarding Kitty Grigg, I'll do
to him as I did to his servant this morning!
So help me!"
</p>

<p>
The bird-lover gazed at him searchingly.
</p>

<p>
"Then&mdash;you know the girl?"
</p>

<p>
"Know her?  Yes!" exclaimed Norton
hotly.  "I know her, and she's no daughter
of Abel Grigg!  Who her real family was
will not be hard to find out if I can get in
touch with some of the officers of the
Cincinnati&mdash;but now for work.  Audubon, you
heard what those devils said about a
horse-boat belonging to a Captain Brookfield.
Do you know anything of such a craft?"
</p>

<p>
The other nodded, frowning.
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Brookfield is an odd genius who
has invented a way of driving his forty-ton
boat by horse-power against the river-current.
He is at Louisville now, taking
contracts for his next trip down the river,
and sails next month."
</p>

<p>
"Well, see here!"  Norton felt the fever
gripping him again, but had already glimpsed
a plan of action.  "You get back to Louisville,
see Elisha Ayres, and tell him about
it.  Ayres will communicate with me at
Blue River."
</p>

<p>
"And you&mdash;&mdash;!" queried the astonished
Audubon.
</p>

<p>
"I'll trail that devil of a Grigg," said
Norton hastily.  "He said he was going
to meet 'the boys', and if I can find their
cache we'll nab the whole gang!  By thunder,
Audubon, we've the whole thing in our
hands now!"
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;wait!" cried Audubon hastily, as
Norton turned toward the trail.  "First, get
this man Red Hugh!  If he's a hunter, as
Boone said, then you and he together will
have no trouble picking up Grigg's trail,
and you may need another rifle badly."
</p>

<p>
For a moment Norton considered this,
while the fever swirled through him.  He
was sorely tempted to plunge off on the
trail of Abel Grigg, but knew that there
was sound advice in Audubon's words.
</p>

<p>
"All right," he said shortly.  "Come&mdash;we'll
find Red Hugh first."
</p>

<p>
His excitement overbore his illness for the
moment, and returning to the trail he led
the way to the very crest of the knoll.
Duval and Grigg had been swallowed up in
the forest, but staring them in the face was
a giant cottonwood, blazed north and south.
Pointing to it silently, Norton wheeled and
headed away from the river into the trees.
</p>

<p>
How far they went through that wilderness
he never knew, for after ten minutes he was
fighting desperately against the pain and
sickness which came over him.  Worse than
all, he was growing terribly weak; once he
caught himself reeling, and only by a great
effort did he keep on.  Audubon had a small
compass, by which they held directly south
as Boone had commanded.
</p>

<p>
Then, almost without warning, Norton felt
his knees giving way.  He was very clear-headed,
but he seemed to have lost the power
of motion.  With a single low groan he caught
at a tree, missed it, and plunged down.
Audubon was over him on the instant,
raising him against the tree, dread anxiety
in face and voice.
</p>

<p>
"It's just&mdash;weakness," gasped Norton.
"A touch of fever, I think.  Get Red
Hugh&mdash;put him on the trail of Grigg.  I'll be all
right with a bit of rest.  Hurry, man!"
</p>

<p>
Audubon looked about, biting his lips.
Before he could reply, however, a bush to
one side of them waved slightly, the sunlight
glinted on a rifle-barrel, and a voice
rang out in harsh command:
</p>

<p>
"Hands up, you skunk!  Drop that rifle&mdash;quick!"
</p>

<p>
Helpless, the naturalist obeyed.  Norton
tried to reach his rifle, but could not move,
and with another groan of despair fell back,
waiting grimly for what might come.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
</h3>

<p>
Into the clearing before them stepped a
strange figure, rifle still covering the startled
Audubon&mdash;a tall man clad in buckskin and
coonskin cap, with, of course, moccasins.
He was gaunt and huge-boned, grey hair
falling over his shoulders and a grizzled
red moustache and beard half-hiding his
face.  For all that, Norton was startled by
the man's features.
</p>

<p>
They were anything but those of a riverman.
True, the sunken grey eyes held a
smouldering ferocity which was almost
madness; but the high brow, fine nose, and
shapely head, even the delicate lines of
mouth and chin beneath the flowing beard&mdash;all
these expressed a keen intelligence,
almost a nobility, which was utterly
astounding to Norton.
</p>

<p>
"What's this&mdash;what's this!"  The stranger
lowered his rifle suddenly as his eyes fell
on Norton's features.  Carefully uncocking
the weapon, he stared at the two friends,
an indescribable expression of chagrin
overspreading his countenance.  "Gentlemen, I
must crave your pardon.  From his moccasins
I took this gentleman for an Indian,"&mdash;and
he gravely indicated Norton&mdash;"for he is
deeply browned and his features were all
but hidden from me.  God be thanked I did
not shoot first!"
</p>

<p>
"Amen to that!" cried Norton feebly,
essaying a faint smile.  Audubon, no less
astonished at the looks and speech of the
stranger, made a slight bow, and spoke
coldly:
</p>

<p>
"If your murderous impulse has quite
abated, sir, pray lend this gentleman your
aid.  We are seeking the cabin of a man
called Red Hugh.  Do you know where it is?"
</p>

<p>
From what Boone had told him, and from
the appearance and manner of the stranger,
Norton had a very shrewd suspicion that
this was no other than Red Hugh himself.
Leaning on his long rifle, the man surveyed
the two friends critically.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he returned at length, "I may
say yes to that question, sir.  But I will
barter my information for yours.  You,
sir"&mdash;and he bent his sunken grey eyes on
Norton&mdash;"are wearing a pair of Shawnee
moccasins.  As you probably know, the
beads and quill-work on those moccasins
are peculiar.  In fact, there is only one man
besides yourself in the Northwest who wears
such moccasins, and he is an Indian&mdash;the
only Indian I have ever held under my
rifle and spared.  Where did you get them?"
</p>

<p>
Norton sat up, fighting off the dizzy
weakness that all but mastered him.  The
man's words sent eager curiosity through him.
</p>

<p>
"I had them from an Indian," he returned
quickly, and gave a brief account of the
two he had encountered.  Before he finished,
a fresh spasm of nausea overwhelmed him,
and he sank back in Audubon's arms.
</p>

<p>
"Enough of this talk," cried the naturalist
angrily.  "If you will guide us to this Red
Hugh, sir, pray do so at once.  We come
to him from Colonel Boone&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"If you had said that before, you would
have bettered matters," broke in the tall
stranger.  "I am he whom you seek.  Come."
</p>

<p>
Norton had lost all interest in the
proceedings, for he could no longer fight off
the fever.  Between them the other two
got him to his feet and half-carried him
along a faint trail indicated by Red Hugh.
After what seemed centuries to the reeling
Norton, they came to a cabin, and he dimly
felt himself carried inside.  He knew little
of what happened next, save that he drank
a bitter draught and fell asleep.
</p>

<p>
When he wakened, he stared around him
with wondering eyes, trying to place himself.
He tried to move, and found himself
too weak to raise his arm; yet the terrible
sickness had passed.
</p>

<p>
He was lying on a couch of skins, and
by the deepness of the sun outside he guessed
it was mid-afternoon.  The cabin was a bare
place enough save for the furs heaped around
the floor, but directly opposite him, beside
the hearth, was a strange contrivance made
of a stretched elkskin almost covering the
side wall.  From where he lay he could see a
row of words across the top of the big skin,
clearly done in red paint as if with a brush:
</p>

<p class="t3">
  WYANDOT&mdash;SHAWNEE&mdash;MIAMI&mdash;<br />
  CREEK&mdash;DELAWARE&mdash;POTT.&mdash;OTTAWA.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Under each tribal name was smaller writing
which he could not read.
</p>

<p>
For a space he stared at the thing in
wonder.  Then, with a rush, he remembered
that he lay in the cabin of Red Hugh, and
all which had gone before.  There was work
to be done!  Abel Grigg must be trailed to
his meeting-place with the other pirates.
Norton made a terrible effort to rise, but
collapsed with a groan of despair.
</p>

<p>
At the sound, a figure darkened the doorway,
and he looked up to see the tall form
of Red Hugh bending over him.  His head
was lifted and a rolled skin set beneath it:
then the old backwoodsman drew up a stool,
fetched a bowl of hot broth from the fire,
and set to work feeding him with a spoon.
</p>

<p>
"Talk later," he said gently.  "First, you
must eat.  You have slept since yesterday,
friend, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Norton, feeling new strength with the first
mouthful of broth, pushed the spoon away
desperately.  The words shocked him into
energy, and again he tried to sit up.
</p>

<p>
"Since yesterday!" he exclaimed.  "But
Grigg must be followed&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The iron hand of Red Hugh pushed him back.
</p>

<p>
"Eat!"  And the deep command forced
him to obey.  "You lack only strength,
Norton, and that will come in a few days.
Now, to relieve your anxiety, your friend
Audubon told me all that had passed.  We
tried to trail Grigg, but the scoundrel had
covered his tracks like an Indian and I
feared to leave you alone here.  So Audubon
went back to Louisville to confer with
Ayres, and for the present matters must be
left as they are."
</p>

<p>
"Then you know my errand?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Audubon told me the whole affair.
Now finish this broth."
</p>

<p>
Leaning back, Norton obeyed, in a
mingling of disappointment and content.  It
was hard that Grigg should have escaped,
yet this Red Hugh seemed a capable person
to trust in.  Norton could not but wonder
at the man.  According to Boone, Red Hugh
had spent the past twenty years here on the
border, yet his manners and speech were those
of a cultivated gentleman&mdash;and Norton could
not understand the incongruity of it.
</p>

<p>
The rich broth gave him new life.  When
the last drop was gone, Red Hugh proceeded
to cram an ancient pipe with tobacco,
sternly denying the luxury to his guest, and
settled himself beside the couch.
</p>

<p>
"Shawnee moccasins!  Shawnee moccasins!"
he muttered slowly, then brought his
keen eyes to Norton's face.  "Audubon said
you were from New Orleans?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," returned the Louisianian, with
curiosity again stirring in him.  "You
seemed to recognize those moccasins,
sir&mdash;how shall I call you?"
</p>

<p>
"Call me by my name&mdash;Red Hugh," said
the other gruffly.  "That is all the name I
have held these twenty years, and it is good
enough to die under.  As to those moccasins,
sir, you seem to have entertained an angel
and a devil unawares."
</p>

<p>
"Those two Indians?" demanded Norton
eagerly.  "Who were they, then?"
</p>

<p>
"He with one eye is called the Prophet,"
puffed Red Hugh slowly.  "The bitterest-hearted
devil unhung!  The other, his
brother, is the finest man on the border
to-day, the one redskin I am proud to call
friend.  He has sat here where you now lie,
telling me of his dream; he has built a
town on the Wabash, not far from Vincennes,
where he hopes to gather all the Indian
tribes in peace, teaching them to lay aside
the rifle and till the soil.  Neither he nor
his followers touch liquor&mdash;sir, God will
punish our race for the evils we have brought
upon these Indians!  The man of whom I
speak is a Shawnee, humbly born yet
recognized as chieftain by a dozen tribes.  His
name is Tecumthe, or as the border makes
it, Tecumsey."
</p>

<p>
The amazed Norton listened to this speech
in blank astonishment.  He had heard little
of the two Indians in the South, and only
on his Northern trip had he learned much
of Tecumthe or his famous brother, the
Prophet.  Along the border they were hated
bitterly, and that he had himself aided the
two was no small surprise.
</p>

<p>
Even more amazing, however, was the
way in which Red Hugh spoke.  From
Boone, Norton had understood that the
man hunted Indians, as more than one
frontiersman did, like wild animals.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me this," he asked, bewildered.
"I thought you hated all redskins, Hugh?
If that is true, what care you for the evil
we have brought upon them, and why do
you think so highly of Tecumthe?"
</p>

<p>
The other puffed in silence for a moment,
his face set like stone.
</p>

<p>
"Look at that elk-hide yonder," he said,
at length, gesturing with his pipe toward
the stretched skin, his voice deeply stirred.
"Norton, that skin bears record of a hundred
and a score Indians I have slain.  Twenty
years ago a band of red devils murdered my
whole family, my wife, my children, killed
my dearest friend, left me for dead&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He paused, and after a space continued,
his voice firmer.
</p>

<p>
"I recovered, and having naught to live
for save vengeance, I took vengeance.  Every
redskin I have slain has been a warrior
under arms, and I have hunted them without
pity or mercy, even as they have hunted
me.  This man Tecumthe is different.  His
heart is white, Norton.  While the Prophet
is stirring up war, Tecumthe is urging peace;
he has a great vision of uplifting his race&mdash;but
he cannot do it.  His men are murdered
along the frontier and he can get no justice.
His lands are stolen, and Harrison will do
nothing.  If he loses the Wabash Valley,
the Shawnees will be thrown back on the
Sioux and Blackfeet, their mortal enemies.
Well, let us get off this subject, Norton.
You know who I am, and that is enough.
We have to deal, not with Indians, but
with men worse than Indians."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Norton bitterly.  "This gang
of river-pirates has murdered more men
within the last year or two than have all
all the Indians since Fallen Timbers.  Too
bad Grigg escaped you; we had the whole
gang under our hand right there, could we
have trapped him."
</p>

<p>
Red Hugh laid aside his pipe and fell to
stroking his grizzled beard as they discussed
what was to be done.  Norton was dismayed to
find that he would be unable to get around for
several days, though Red Hugh promised him
a complete cure from his fever and wounds.
</p>

<p>
Nor could he obtain the information for
which he had hoped, from this strange
character.  Red Hugh, who seemed well
educated and only a trifle "touched" on
the subject of killing Indians, had a supreme
contempt for the settlers along the river,
in the main.  He had been only once to
Louisville, and had lived his solitary life
as far as might be without concerning himself
with settlements.  He knew nothing of the
Blacknose gang, though he stated bluntly
that once he and Norton set themselves to
hunt down the pirates, it would be a matter
of short accomplishment.
</p>

<p>
So with that small ray of comfort,
Norton went about his recovery, impatiently
enough.  When three days had passed, he
felt nearly himself once more; but in that
space of time he had discovered many things.
</p>

<p>
In the first place, he was forced to reverse
his earlier impressions of Red Hugh.  While
he was ill, the man took a lively interest
in caring for him; no sooner was Norton
on his feet, than Red Hugh relapsed into
a brooding morose individual who refused
to talk about himself or his doings and
only betrayed interest in Blacknose.
Studying the man, Norton concluded that
he had been a gentleman and a man of
some consequence, but since the destruction
of his family had devoted his whole life
to revenge with a consequent loss of sanity
on other topics.
</p>

<p>
He seemed to have absolutely no other
business in life than killing Indians, for a
living was easily gained by hunting.  He
had never troubled to take up land, and
since there were no settlements in the
vicinity, no one interfered with his squatting.
All his vivacity and gentle care vanished
as soon as Norton regained strength, and
with this interest gone, he would sit and
stare by the hour at his terrible elkskin.
</p>

<p>
This Norton also found of keen interest,
for every "hunt" had been carefully set
down as to date and result.  When they
took the field against Blacknose, he
conjectured shrewdly that Red Hugh would
re-awaken once more, for judging by the
elk-skin he was possessed of considerable prowess
in the man-hunt.  He must have gone about
his revenge with a terrible skill; more than
once the painted record showed that parties of
two and three Indians had fallen to his rifle.
</p>

<p>
John Norton was in no sense horrified,
though not at all in sympathy with the old
man.  There were many like him along the
border.  The settlers conceived and treated
the red men as beasts, which too often they
were, and no man was ever brought to
justice for killing an Indian.  Red Hugh's
grievances were purely personal, however,
and more than once Norton recalled Boone's
words&mdash;"God ain't softened his heart yet,
though He will some day, I reckon."  That
day, it seemed to Norton, was very far distant.
</p>

<p>
Only once, after that first talk with the
man, did he ever refer to his slain
family.  He had been examining Norton's
moccasins, on the third evening, and
suddenly he favoured the Louisianian with
one of his searching looks.
</p>

<p>
"If you were up in the Shawnee country,"
he said abruptly, "these leathers would
either get you killed or crowned, Norton!
Any Indian across the Ohio would recognize
them instantly.  Well&mdash;well&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He stared into the fireplace, puffing at
his pipe.  After a moment he continued
slowly as if musing to himself:
</p>

<p>
"They were Wyandots, a big war-party
of them, and their chief wore moccasins
with split soles.  They killed us all, women
and children alike&mdash;and after I recovered I
went straight into the Wyandot country.
I found that chief, a year later, and shot
him in the midst of his own village; old
Simon Kenton was with me, and we had a
hard fight before we got away.  Well, I had
my revenge, but it did not bring back the
dead wife and the little ones&mdash;the little
ones&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Upon that he strode from the cabin
suddenly, and Norton never referred to his
own similar story, deeming it best to keep
Red Hugh's mind as far as possible from
Indian atrocities.  The man seemed no more
than sixty years old, and save for that one
topic his brain was as vigorous as that of
Norton himself.
</p>

<p>
By the fourth evening the Louisianian
was nearly himself again.  Red Hugh's
knowledge of herbs had rid him of the fever
almost at once, and strength came back to
him surely and swiftly.  Burning with
anxiety to waste no time, yet conscious of
the necessity of regaining his strength, he
had forced himself to bide in the idleness
of recuperation, but now he could do so no
longer.  There was work to be done, and he
was bent upon keeping control of things&mdash;for
his own career lay in the balance.  He
had not resigned his commission in mad
haste, but after much deliberation; did he
succeed in eliminating the Blacknose gang,
New Orleans and the Government had
promised great things.
</p>

<p>
More than this, however, he had Kitty
Grigg in mind.  Once the present affair was
concluded he promised himself a trip to
Cincinnati, where many of the original
members of the famous Order had settled.
It should not be difficult to make inquiries
and perhaps gain a clue to the girl's real
family, he thought.  So, calling Red Hugh
into a gloomy consideration of the problem
immediately at hand, he announced his
intention of beginning work next day.
</p>

<p>
"The first thing is to go to Blue River
and get word from Elisha Ayres," he said
thoughtfully.  "I can't go back to Louisville
unless that murder charge is cleared up,
which should have been done by this time.
If not, we'll have to go on a thorough scout
of the river, because Grigg and his band of
pirates are somewhere down-stream."
</p>

<p>
Red Hugh nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Where are you going to meet the messenger
from Ayres?"
</p>

<p>
"At Dodd's Tavern&mdash;Kentucky side."
</p>

<p>
"H'm!"  The other frowned.  "I haven't
been there for two years, Norton, but I
don't recall any tavern or settler of that
name at either of the Blue River settlements.
However, your friend doubtless
knew what he was talking about."
</p>

<p>
"He seemed to," said Norton drily.  "Blue
River is only about twelve miles from
here&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I have a canoe down on the shore.  Feel
strong enough to paddle?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite.  If we find no word from Ayres,
we can go on below Henderson and spend
a couple of weeks scouting through the
woods.  The gang must have some sort of
a rendezvous, Hugh, and it certainly has
a cache of the stolen goods, for Grigg has
to be careful in disposing of them.  Which
side of the river would you search?"
</p>

<p>
Red Hugh stared at his elk-hide, tugging
at his grizzled beard.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he returned slowly, his deep-set
eyes flaming a little, "they'd be like to use
either side, Norton.  If we skirmished around
on the Indiana side around the Wabash, we
might strike one or two Indian parties&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"None of that," broke in Norton,
understanding that ominous flame in the man's
eye.  "We're after Blacknose, not after
scalps.  Just impress that on your mind
and save further trouble.  If you give me
your help in this thing, there'll be no Indian
hunting."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The big man turned his slow gaze to
Norton's face, and for a moment the
Louisianian expected trouble.  Red Hugh
stared at him; Norton met the look firmly,
resolved not to compromise this matter, much
as he needed the man's help and advice.  At
length Red Hugh nodded, reluctantly.
</p>

<p>
"I like you, Norton," he said, his grim
visage softening strangely.  "You're a man.
You're like another Norton I once knew&mdash;well,
best not to speak of that.  Now as to
hunting this Blacknose gang: we are more
like to find them on the Indiana side.  If
aught went wrong with their plans, they
could escape to the Indian country, or else
lay the blame for their crimes on the
Shawnees.  There are several bands of
Miamis along there, also.  It may well be
that through some Indians we can get trace
of the gang, if naught else serves."
</p>

<p>
Upon this, they made ready to set forth
at dawn.  Norton discarded his own battered
powderhorn for the fine red-streaked one
which the assassin Tobin had formerly
carried&mdash;an act which was destined to bring dire
results upon himself before the game was
played out.  He forgot the fact that this
red-streaked horn was distinguished by its
very oddness and beauty.
</p>

<p>
With the dawn they set forth for the
blazed cottonwood and the Ohio, carrying
their rifles and a quarter of venison.  Upon
reaching the bluff over the river, Red Hugh
turned abruptly aside and led Norton down
to the wooded banks, where he presently fished
out an Indian birch canoe and paddles from
a clump of dense bushes.  Two canoes were
paddling upstream along the opposite shore,
and when these were past, they put their craft
in the water and started for Blue River.
</p>

<p>
The river hills ran close to the stream on
each side, and except for the little group of
cabins under the high rocky cliff opposite
them the banks were unsettled as far as Blue
River.  Norton paddled easily, drinking in
fresh strength with the sun-bright morning
air, and could scarce realize their journey was
nearly done when Red Hugh pointed to Blue
River ahead.  They had passed Indian Creek
and two islands without sight of other
river-craft, and now held in to the Kentucky
shore.
</p>

<p>
"Colonel Boone's brother, Squire, began
that settlement"&mdash;and Red Hugh pointed
across to the clustering cabins opposite.
"Now if you can see any signs of a tavern
over here, you beat me."
</p>

<p>
In truth, Norton gazed at the Kentucky
settlement which they were approaching, and
his heart sank.  Ayres must have made
some mistake&mdash;yet the schoolmaster had
been very explicit in his directions.  The
settlement consisted of two cabins, one of
them fast falling to ruin; a few tobacco-drying
sheds; a small section of cleared
land; and a half-naked woman staring hard
at them.  Two or three entirely naked children
appeared as they paddled in, and as the
slatternly woman raised her voice, a still
more slatternly man came slouching from
the tobacco-sheds, rifle in hand.  There was
no sign of any road or ferry, and this was
most certainly no tavern.  Norton landed
with some dismay.
</p>

<p>
"Is this the Kentucky Blue River settlement?"
he inquired of the suspicious man&mdash;a
loose-jawed, fever-smitten person who
lacked all interest in life.
</p>

<p>
"I reckon they call it that, stranger.
Who be ye?"
</p>

<p>
"We're looking for Dodd's Tavern,"
returned Norton quietly.  "If you can
tell&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Eh?  Dodd's Tavern?  Well, by gum!"  The
man stared at him, then turned to the
woman behind him.  "Go git that gal."
</p>

<p>
The woman went to the house.  Red Hugh
drew up his canoe and joined Norton, and
together they waited for what was evidently
to happen.  The woman reappeared from
the cabin, nodded, and fell to staring.  A
moment later Kitty Grigg emerged, and
came forward with a glad, eager little cry
at sight of Norton.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Norton!  Oh, I'm so glad you've
come&mdash;I had almost given you up!"
</p>

<p>
"You!"  Norton grasped her hand, thunder-struck.
"Why, girl&mdash;what does this mean?
How came you here?"
</p>

<p>
"By boat," she laughed.  "And I have
news from Mr. Ayres."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
</h3>

<p>
Utterly astounded as he was at sight
of Kathleen Grigg, and even more so by
Ayres having chosen such a messenger,
Norton drew her out of earshot of the curious
settlers to the canoe, and introduced Red
Hugh.  The latter stared at the girl, then
stretched forth a huge hand and touched
the flame of her red-gold hair with trembling
fingers, awe in his whole face.
</p>

<p>
"Kitty Grigg!" he muttered thickly, as
the half-frightened girl shrank back to
Norton's arm.  "Kitty Grigg!  Yet she has the
face of my own Mary&mdash;oh, God in heaven!"
</p>

<p>
Abruptly, he turned his back upon them
and stood leaning on his rifle, his shoulders
shaking.  Norton realized swiftly that the
old man had found some resemblance in
her to that wife whom he had lost in such
tragic fashion, and in quick pity he gave
the girl a warning look and hastened to
change the current of Red Hugh's thoughts.
</p>

<p>
"But, Kitty&mdash;how on earth came Ayres
to send you, of all people?" he cried in
half-anger, half-wonder.  "He knew there
was danger in it&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Listen, please," she broke in, her hand
on his arm and her eyes searching his face
hungrily.  "After you left me, that day,
I saw Colonel Boone and told him what
you had said.  He knew nothing about the
pin, but he said to trust you and&mdash;and I
do.  Then father went off on a month's hunt,
so I was going to visit with Mistress Zach
Taylor had not Mr. Ayres and Mr. Audubon
come to see me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Audubon?  When was this?" queried
Norton, frowning.
</p>

<p>
"Four days since&mdash;directly he returned
after leaving you with him"&mdash;and she nodded
toward Red Hugh, flushing slightly as she
did so.  "Mr. Audubon related all that had
happened to you and him, but as he was
going away with Mr. Ayres they were not sure
whom to send here until they thought of me.
You see, I would not be suspected or watched,
and there was a skiff all ready to&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;then you must know&mdash;&mdash;"  Norton
broke off suddenly, staring into her level
grey eyes, wondering if she had been told
who Blacknose really was.  She looked
steadily at him, read his thought, and her
face went pale.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she nodded quietly.  "Mr. Audubon
told me all about it.  I do not quite believe
it can be possible, despite what you and
Mr. Audubon heard.  You see, sir, Mr. Duval
has exerted some influence over my fa&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Over Abel Grigg, you mean," interrupted
Norton gravely.  He was all the more
astonished that she had come on this mission,
knowing what she did.
</p>

<p>
"Over&mdash;him," she went on, avoiding the
issue.  "But he's not bad at heart, really!
And I came here partly to ask you to help
him&mdash;I mean, if you find there is a gang of
pirates, don't be too harsh with him until
he is proven guilty&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I promise you that, sweet Kitty," smiled
Norton.  Then of a sudden the warmth died
out of his brown eyes, and his face went
hard.  "Perhaps you were not told how he
agreed to sell you to Duval, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she almost whispered.  "I&mdash;I&mdash;oh,
I do not know what to think or say!
But never mind that now, Mr. Norton;
Mr. Ayres said that you were to return to
Louisville at once&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You just said he and Audubon were
going away?" broke in the puzzled Norton.
</p>

<p>
"They'll be back when you get there.
Mr. Ayres has a plan about some boat, and
has gone up-river to get some men he can
trust.  The riverman who was murdered had
two brothers&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hold on," laughed Norton.  "How can
I go back when everyone thinks I committed
that murder?  Straighten me out little by
little, Kitty!"
</p>

<p>
"Nobody thinks you did it.  Mr. Ayres
found that the knife with which the man
was murdered belonged to someone else, and
also established the fact that you had been
outside the tavern all the while.  So that
is all right.  The owner of the knife escaped
in a canoe."
</p>

<p>
"And I'll wager his name was Tobin,"
exclaimed Norton quickly.  She looked at
him, surprised.
</p>

<p>
"What&mdash;how did you know that?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I met Mr. Tobin myself."  Norton
smiled grimly and glanced at his powder-horn.
"Well, that's a relief, Kitty!  Now,
how about getting back?"
</p>

<p>
"I came down in a skiff that was going
to Henderson," she explained.  "That was
day before yesterday, and the skiff was to
start back this morning and stop for me.
Mr. Ayres knew there was no tavern here,
but that was why he used the name, in
case of suspicion."
</p>

<p>
"So&mdash;I am beginning to understand!  This
Mr. Ayres is a sly fox, eh?"
</p>

<p>
Norton whistled softly.  In asking for
Dodd's Tavern he had merely made use of
a password which was known to the vacuous-eyed
settler, and had thus precluded any
possibility of mistake.
</p>

<p>
"Wait here, Kitty," he said, and crossed
to Red Hugh.  The latter swung about,
showing his usual grim searching expression.
"You heard it all, Hugh?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."  The big man nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I fancy that Ayres is going to
load up a boat and use it as a lure," went
on Norton in a low voice.  "It may well
be Brookfield's horse-boat, of which we heard
Duval and Grigg speaking, and which will
leave Louisville in two or three weeks.
Hold on!"  And he turned to the watching
girl again.  "What did you say about Ayres
going away to raise some men?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm not quite sure myself," she answered,
"but I gathered that he was going for that
purpose&mdash;he spoke about some men whose
relatives had disappeared with the vanished
boats&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"That's it, then," said Norton quickly.
"He'll get a few men he can rely upon
implicitly and stow them aboard the boat.
Then, when Blacknose attacks, he'll find
what he hadn't bargained for, Hugh!  Now
will you come back to Louisville?  That
skiff ought to be along in an hour or two,
if she left Henderson this morning&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No," broke in Red Hugh decisively.
"You stay here and take Madam Grigg back,
Norton.  I'll scout through the woods for a bit,
then will pick up your boat at Henderson when
she comes down.  You'll be aboard her?"
</p>

<p>
Norton assented with a nod.
</p>

<p>
"Good.  If there's no sign of me at Henderson,
I'll signal you from Diamond Island,
just below&mdash;be sure and take the left-hand
channel, for I'll be on the Kentucky side.
Brookfield's boat, eh?  All right&mdash;I'll watch
out for you."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
With a final look at Kitty Grigg, Red
Hugh touched his cap and went to the
canoe with Norton.  The latter took out
his rifle and equipment; then Red Hugh
stepped into the craft and shoved off.  A
wave of the hand, and he paddled off
upstream in the direction whence they had
come that morning.  Norton stood watching
him out of sight, a most unwelcome feeling
of loneliness stealing upon him; despite the
man's glum silences and bloodthirsty pursuit,
he had a strange fascination for Norton.
</p>

<p>
"Who is that man?  Is he the&mdash;the Red
Hugh of whom Mr. Audubon spoke?"
</p>

<p>
The Louisianian turned, and smiled into
the girl's wondering grey eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I doubt if there be two of that name,
Kitty!  Aye, he's the man, and an odd one.
Come&mdash;let's sit on the bank over here where
we can watch the river.  I trust your
skiff will return as she promised, for a
night in this place would be little to my
liking."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, they're kindly folk enough, but
terribly poor," she returned, as Norton led
her down the bank under the shade of a
clump of cottonwood.  "And such wretched,
happy, dirty little babies!  I wish I could
do something for them."
</p>

<p>
He watched her, fascinated by her fresh
beauty, wondering anew how this pearl of
womanhood came to be fixed in the squat
cabin of Abel Grigg.  For a space they sat
in silence; she gazed out over the river,
hands clasped in her lap, while Norton
filled his pipe and smoked, feeling suddenly
content with all things.
</p>

<p>
It was coming out all right, he felt,
despite the failure to trail Grigg down and
trap the whole gang.  Of the relation between
Grigg and the girl beside him, he never
bothered, being perfectly convinced in his
own mind that she was another man's
daughter.  He remembered the promise he
had given her, but the deeper memory of
that verbal bill of sale had impressed him
with a hatred and contempt for both Grigg
and Duval, which nothing would eradicate
from his mind.
</p>

<p>
He recalled the vow he had taken upon
that golden eagle, and perhaps the thought
leaped to Kathleen's mind, for she turned
with a sudden little laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I forgot!  Have you still got that
gold eagle pin?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."  Norton put his hand to his breast.
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
He could not understand the half-smile that
lay in her eyes as she looked at him.  Knowing
that he was puzzled, she laughed again.
</p>

<p>
"Haven't you looked at it since that day?"
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;but I will now."
</p>

<p>
He reached inside his shirt and unfastened
the pin.  As the sunlight fell on it, he
frowned slightly; the broken enamel on its
face did not seem&mdash;suddenly he turned it
over, and read the initials "H.E.M."
</p>

<p>
"By thunder!" he exclaimed, looking up at
the laughing girl.  "I handed you the wrong
pin, eh?  It was a mistake, Kathleen&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She nodded.  "Yes.  I discovered it after
you had gone, so when I came I brought
this one of yours with me."
</p>

<p>
Norton looked at the pin she held out,
recognizing it for his own.  Yet he made no
move to take it.  Much as it meant to him,
being his only memorial from the father he
could not remember, he only looked at it
and admired the slim beauty of the palm
on which it lay.  Hers was not the hand of
a backwoods woman, he thought.
</p>

<p>
"Listen, Kitty," he said slowly.  "Just
as soon as I've cleared up this Blacknose
affair here, I'm going to Cincinnati and find
out who the owner of this pin of yours really
was.  A number of the Cincinnati are there
or in the neighbourhood, and they will have
records of the Order.  Let me keep your
eagle until then, and you keep mine as an
earnest that I will return yours."
</p>

<p>
He found her face suddenly grave.
</p>

<p>
"I do not want to lose it," she said quietly.
"It means a good deal to me, after what
you have said&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Nor do I want to lose mine," he broke
in, smiling.  "Oh, you are not so easily
rid of me, Kitty!  I will find your true
name for you, and that's a promise; until
then, I will keep your eagle and do you keep
mine in pledge of my return.  Not that you
need the pledge, since it would be a far harder
matter to keep away from your eyes&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Fie, sir!"  And she interrupted merrily
enough.  "And how many pledges have you
left behind in Louisiana?"
</p>

<p>
"Two," returned Norton, so that for a
moment her face became as serious as his own.
"One to my friend, Davy Crockett, in shape
of my finest rifle; and one to the traders who
sent me hither, in shape of a promise that
I would wipe out Blacknose.  Tell me, Kitty,
do you wish to marry Charles Duval?"
</p>

<p>
"Do you think I wish it?"  And she
inspected him with half-frightened eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Well"&mdash;Norton shifted his rifle uneasily,&mdash;"he
is a person of note, is a gentleman of
family&mdash;and is able to buy you with money."
</p>

<p>
"So much might be said for the Indian
Tecumthe," she returned, flushing at the
brutality of his last words.  "No, I shall
not marry him."
</p>

<p>
"Bravely said," nodded Norton, and felt
tremendously relieved.  Of course, he told
himself, his only interest lay in saving this
helpless girl from two scoundrels.  "Well, even
if Abel Grigg swears you're under age&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"There's the skiff coming!" she cried
quickly.  "Just crossing over."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Norton glanced up.  Perhaps a mile down
the river and with her eight sweeps bringing
her slowly across in a long slant for the
Kentucky side, was a large boat.  There was
no hurry, he calculated, for she would require
a good fifteen or twenty minutes to head over
across the swift current of the Ohio&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"<i>&mdash;&mdash;then you take this horse and rejoin
the boys.  I'll get back in that boat.</i>"
</p>

<p>
The cold, commanding words rang out
clearly from somewhere behind and above.
</p>

<p>
Norton stiffened; with one quick motion he
unstopped his powderhorn and poured some
black grains into the pan of his rifle, as it
lay across his knees.
</p>

<p>
"The durned spy must ha' lit out," came
the growl of Abel Grigg's voice.  "Tobin
ain't showed up, neither."
</p>

<p>
The Louisianian glanced swiftly at
Kathleen.  She was staring at him wide-eyed,
her face ghastly in its sudden pallor.
He knew that she must have realized instantly
what had occurred&mdash;Duval, on his way
home from Henderson, had met Grigg and
intended to turn over his horse to the
backwoodsman and catch this skiff back to
Louisville.  Cursing the mischance of fate
which had led to such a happening, and
thinking only of keeping the girl unseen,
Norton leaned forward and whispered, with
a gesture toward the trees:
</p>

<p>
"I'll back them into the woods.  Get
under those trees, and when the boat comes
get aboard."
</p>

<p>
"No," she returned, with a shake of the
head.  "Why should I be afraid?"
</p>

<p>
Reading determination in her eyes, Norton
cursed again, silently, and leaped up.
Discovery was certain; his only chance now
lay in holding up the two men and surprising
some confession from them.  With Audubon
as sole witness, he could hardly hope to
force Duval into court; but with Kathleen's
testimony and that of the settlers, there
was a bare chance.  His rifle ready, he left
the girl and sprang up the bank.
</p>

<p>
A curious scene greeted him, and one
which showed that Elisha Ayres had not
selected this settler's cabin by any vagary.
The squalid woman and babies had vanished;
the settler himself sat in the doorway of his
shack with his rifle ostentatiously in hand;
paying no heed to him, Duval and Grigg
were standing near the landing, the latter
holding the horse's bridle in one hand, his
rifle in the other.  Duval had a pair of
pistols in his belt.
</p>

<p>
"Hands up, gentlemen!" commanded
Norton sharply.  "Drop that rifle, Blacknose!"
</p>

<p>
As Norton levelled his weapon, the settler
in the doorway rose also, watching the
other two.  Duval, whirling with one terrible
convulsion of his features, looked into
Norton's rifle and forced the look from his
face; Grigg obeyed the command with a
snarl, his powerful, hook-nosed face
grimacing in surprise and consternation.
</p>

<p>
"Why&mdash;sir!  What is the meaning of this,
Mr. Norton?"
</p>

<p>
Duval's expression of astonishment was
an excellent counterfeit.  His virile, dark,
thin-lipped face showed only blank surprise,
but this did not deceive Norton.
</p>

<p>
"You're a pretty pair of scoundrels!"
he said grimly.  "Your game's up, Duval,
so no need to play innocent.  Grigg, you're
known for Blacknose.  I think you'll both
go to Louisville on that boat, but you'll
go bound."
</p>

<p>
He saw Grigg's eyes widen and his jaw fall in
astonishment, and needed not the step behind
him to know that Kathleen had come up.
Duval, however, maintained his cold poise.
</p>

<p>
"You are making a grievous mistake,
Captain Norton," he returned, softly.  "You
must either be out of your senses or&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"So?" chuckled Norton easily.  "You
remember how you and Blacknose there
paused on your way to Henderson a few
days ago, and held a conversation just before
you parted company?  There were witnesses
to that conversation, my friend."
</p>

<p>
Grigg went livid, and his bushy grizzled
beard quivered as he stared at Norton.
Duval, however, showed no sign of emotion
beyond a tightening of his lips; his dark
eyes glittered ominously, and the cruel
curve of his nostrils deepened.  In that
moment Norton knew that he had lost his
play, and would get nothing out of this man.
Grigg opened his mouth to speak, but Duval
shut him up sharply.
</p>

<p>
"I said, sir, that you were mistaken,"
returned the lawyer coldly.  "The tenor of
that conversation must have been misunderstood
by you.  Madam Grigg, your servant."
</p>

<p>
He bowed slightly to the girl.  With an
inward groan, Norton lowered his rifle.  If
he brought the matter to an issue, he knew
well that he would fail; neither Duval nor
Grigg had mentioned Blacknose by name,
and the conversation was incriminating only
by inference.  And inference counted for
nothing in the Kentucky courts.
</p>

<p>
"Duval, I'm going to get you."  And
Norton suppressed the rage within him, his
voice as cold and level as that of the lawyer.
"You're the man behind this Blacknose gang,
and Grigg there is Blacknose.  I know that
much, and I'm going to prove it some day."
</p>

<p>
"You will have far to travel before that
day, sir," returned Duval with a thinly
veiled sneer.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps."  And Norton smiled a little
as their eyes clinched.  "Not as far, however,
as the road your friend Tobin has already
travelled."
</p>

<p>
The shot told.  Duval's eyes narrowed
suddenly; then a hoarse cry broke from
Grigg, who pointed at Norton's waist.
</p>

<p>
"Look thar!  The cuss has got Tobin's
horn&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What is that to us?"  Duval whirled on
him, with so terrible a face that Grigg fell
back.  "What is Tobin to us, you fool?
Do you know him?"
</p>

<p>
"No," stammered Grigg, giving Norton
a furious look.  "No, I don't know him."
</p>

<p>
The Louisianian smiled in contempt.  Duval
had outguessed him shrewdly, and he would
now get no evidence out of either man.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Norton"&mdash;Duval turned to him
with a smooth smile&mdash;"I trust you perceive
your mistake."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," returned Norton quietly, giving
the man a hard look.  "You're smarter
than I thought, Duval.  But you'll swing
yet&mdash;mark that!"
</p>

<p>
The lawyer made no reply, beyond a
cold sneer.  A glance showed Norton that
the settler's rifle had vanished, and knowing
that Duval would not dare shoot him down
with the approaching boat so near, he lowered
his own rifle and stood leaning on it.  Grigg,
however, stepped forward with an oath.
</p>

<p>
"I got a word to say here," he cried
savagely, glaring past Norton at the girl.
"What you doin' here, Kitty?  You and
him was settin' under the bank makin'
love, eh?  What you doin' here?"
</p>

<p>
Norton turned with a helpless gesture.  The
girl did not heed him, but looked at Grigg,
pale but calm.
</p>

<p>
"Be careful what you say"&mdash;and her
voice trembled a little.  "I came here with
a message for Mr. Norton.  Further than
that, it is no business of yours."
</p>

<p>
"Hey!  No business o' mine, ain't it?"
shot out Grigg, his gaunt head flung forward
until with his keen-hooked nose he looked
uncommonly like the bird of prey that he
was.  "Looky here, gal, don't you talk to
your o' dad like that!  Now you're here,
you'll come along o' me into the woods fer
a spell&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The girl drew herself up angrily.
</p>

<p>
"You're no father of mine, Abel Grigg,"
she cried out, and Norton could not but
admire the proud spirit of her.  "I know that
now, and you've no authority over me!"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Grigg stood as though paralysed.  Duval
stared at the girl for a moment, then turned
and whispered a few low words to his
companion.  Norton would have given much to
know what they were, but their effect was
evident.
</p>

<p>
With a complete change of manner, Grigg
forced the anger from his face and spoke in
a low wheedling voice which yet had a ring
of sincerity in it.
</p>

<p>
"Looky here, Kitty!  You ain't meanin'
that&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I mean what I say," she flashed back at
him.  "I know you're not my father, and
so does Captain Norton.  That's enough."
</p>

<p>
Grigg flung Norton one malignant glance.
</p>

<p>
"Well, gal," he said slowly, "that's true.
I ain't your dad."
</p>

<p>
"Who am I, then?" demanded Kathleen
swiftly.
</p>

<p>
"I dunno."  The backwoodsman shook
his head, and Norton could not but believe
he spoke the truth.  "I found ye nigh on
twenty year back, Kitty, in an Injun
camp.  Wyandots, they was, an' I bought
ye fer a new horn o' powder an' a gun.
That thar's God's truth, gal.  They wouldn't
say nothin' 'bout ye.  Now I've told, gal,
you won't go back on the ol' man?  Come
'long into the woods a spell&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I think not," broke in Norton drily.
"Grigg, we know all about how you want to
sell Kitty to this skunk of a Duval.  She'll
have nothing more to do with you.  That's
flat."
</p>

<p>
"You've been an' set her up to this,
hey?" snarled Grigg suddenly, turning on
the Louisianian.  "All right!  I'll make
ye pay afore I'm done with ye!"
</p>

<p>
Duval gave the angry man a look, and
again Grigg flung off his rage swiftly.
</p>

<p>
"Kitty, won't ye go with me?" he said
slowly, picking up his rifle.
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
Duval stood aside, watching, a shadowy
sneer on his powerful features.  A glance
at the river showed Norton the skiff some
three hundred yards away and slowly
approaching the landing.  Grigg, leaning
on his rifle and clawing his grizzled beard,
looked at the girl with a sudden sadness in
his deep eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Kitty," he said very slowly, the harsh
timbre of his voice accentuating his words
and lending them sincerity, "I've brung ye
up as best I could.  When the ol' woman
died ten year back, it was you helped to
bury her.  'Member that?  Ye allus called
me Dad, didn't ye?  I've done right by
ye, gal, accordin' to my lights.  Ain't I give
ye the best I could?  Ain't I paid ol' Elisha
Ayres to give ye learnin'?  You ain't lacked
fer nothin', Kitty, even if I am poor."
</p>

<p>
Norton, listening, forbore to interfere.
It occurred to him that Grigg was making
a desperate fight for a valuable piece of
property, yet there was truth in what the
man said.  And Kathleen knew it.  Struggle
sat in her face.
</p>

<p>
"Kitty, gal," went on Grigg with renewed
earnestness, "I ain't askin' much of ye.
I've allus give ye the best I had, ain't I?
Now, looky here.  Fur's anyone knows,
you're my daughter an' I could force ye any
ways I wanted to.  But I don't.  I love
ye, gal, an' all I want is fer you to stick by
me a bit longer.  I'm gettin' old, Kitty,
an' ain't as well able to take care o' myself
as I used to be.  If you're mixed up with
that spy feller, Kitty, ye've done me a
mighty bad turn, but I ain't carin' fer
that.  Now ain't you a-goin' to come along
o' me, little gal?  You ain't a-goin' to
leave the ol' man, be ye?"
</p>

<p>
"What do you want of me?"  Sorely
shaken, the girl looked at him.  "Why
shouldn't I go back home, then?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I need ye, gal," returned Grigg
earnestly.  "I'd 'a' brung ye afore, only I
didn't know as I'd need ye.  They's a
camp down-river a piece, where I aim to
set out quite a spell, an' I want ye to cook
an' take care o' things fer us.  Kitty, don't
go back on me after I done brung ye up all
them years!  Even if ye don't love me,
don't ye reckon ye owe me somethin'?  I've
took good care on ye, gal&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Terribly pale, the girl turned to Norton.
He read the weariness of her eyes, and
started to speak, but she stopped him:
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;he's right, Mr. Norton.  I owe him
some duty, though it will never go so far
as marrying that man."  And she flashed
Duval one contemptuous glance.  "Good-bye,
Mr. Norton&mdash;and God bless you!"
</p>

<p>
Norton bowed over her hand, bringing
it to his lips.  The touch thrilled him, and
for a long moment he looked down into her
grey eyes, not trusting himself to speak.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, for the present," he said
huskily, his finely-chiselled face very tender,
"And remember&mdash;I shall see you again."
</p>

<p>
With no more words she turned to Grigg,
who helped her to the saddle of Duval's
horse, and they started away.  Norton
gazed after them, feeling the girl's high
character grip at his heart-strings; then he
turned at a hail from the river landing.
</p>

<p>
"Hey, you fellers!  Who's fer Louisville?"
</p>

<p>
"All right!" replied the Louisianian.  He
looked at Duval, and his eyes flamed out
like a sword.  "Duval," he said softly,
"you're a yellow dog!  You've tried murder
and failed; now play your last card and
do it soon, or you're gone!"
</p>

<p>
Immobile, his face set as though carven in
stone, Duval gazed at him.  Then his strong
white teeth flashed out in a slow smile.
"If you wish to make your last will and
testament, Captain Norton, anyone in Louisville
can direct you to my office.  Sir, your servant!"
</p>

<p>
And with a bow he passed down to the waiting
boat.  Norton followed, smiling a little,
his heart sore within him for Kitty Grigg.
</p>

<p>
"But, by gad, it's in the open now!" he
thought.  "Duval is smart, but his craft
has sprung a leak&mdash;and the tide will swamp
him whether I live or die!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X
</h3>

<p>
The trip to Louisville was uneventful, yet
significant.  As Norton went aboard the boat,
the captain touched his arm and whispered.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Norton?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes?"
</p>

<p>
"The lady&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Does not return with us, sir."
</p>

<p>
The captain stepped back and signed to
his men.  Of these there were ten&mdash;all big,
bearded men who kept silent for the whole trip,
though Duval tried to converse with them
more than once.  Nor did any address
Norton after he was aboard.  Save for the
captain's orders, the trip was made in silence.
</p>

<p>
When they were rowing past the bluff
behind which Red Hugh dwelt, Norton
searched the woods in vain for any sign
of his friends, and caught Duval's eye roving
over the bluff as well.  Buck Creek and Salt
River were passed without stoppage, and
when Norton offered to pay his passage, he
was informed that it has been paid; Duval, a
little later, was taxed a dollar, which he paid
promptly.  At length Sullivan's ferry swept
by and Shippingsport hove in sight ahead.
</p>

<p>
Norton knew nothing of what had been
going on in his absence, but there were a
large number of craft, both keel and
flatboats, in the Louisville harbour, while
loading of freight was proceeding busily.
</p>

<p>
The skiff rowed in through the vessels to
a wharf, and Norton saw a small figure in
scarlet breeches and fustian greatcoat waiting
for their landing.  He leaped out with a
cry of joy, and greeted Elisha Ayres with
a strong grip of the hand.  The little
schoolmaster straightened his greasy wig, and
turned to meet Duval with a low bow.
</p>

<p>
"Your servant, Mr. Duval!" he said, in
his dry precise manner.
</p>

<p>
The lawyer bowed slightly, fastened his
cold gaze on the pinched, twinkling-eyed
face of Ayres, and passed on without speaking.
With a chuckle, Ayres passed his arm
under Norton's and turned.
</p>

<p>
"Come, Mr. Norton.  Do not talk, if you please."
</p>

<p>
In no little wonder, Norton accommodated
his step to that of the other, and they walked
through the little town toward Louisville.
Ayres placed no ban of silence upon his own
tongue, however; he chattered volubly,
pointed out various objects of interest, and
paused at the top of the hill to turn Norton
toward the harbour.
</p>

<p>
"Just to our right, Mr. Norton, is the
Berthoud rope-walk&mdash;one of the finest, I may
say, in the United States.  There is
Mr. Berthoud's residence just beyond us.  Now
from here we get a truly remarkable view
of the shipping; you will observe that a
half-dozen keels are being laden for New Orleans,
under command of Commodore Peters.  The
outside craft is the gunboat of Captain
Nevitt, which carries a small cannon.  To the
left you will see Captain Brookfield's
horse-boat&mdash;a most ingenious contrivance, sir."
</p>

<p>
At length Norton caught the drift of all
this volubility, and gazed at the "horse-boat"
with no little interest.  It was a large
craft of forty tons, with an ungainly gallery
on the upper deck.  On this, as Ayres pointed
out, six or seven horses worked a treadmill
which in turn worked the large side-paddles,
over each gunwale.  The boat was
a decided novelty, and as Brookfield had
broken a number of paddles on his trip
up-river, she would be delayed from joining
the fleet under Peters and Nevitt, which
was leaving in two days.
</p>

<p>
When Norton had finished his inspection,
Ayres turned him toward the city again
and they proceeded on their way.  Duval
had disappeared.  Mindful of the rapidity
with which things had happened to him on
his previous visit, Norton kept a watchful
eye on the passers-by; he had an uneasy
sense of being watched, and perceived that
an unduly large proportion of the men were
roughly dressed but excellently armed.  It
seemed to him that Duval must have filled
the town with his own men, and things
began to loom up darkly before him.
</p>

<p>
"These, sir, are the hanging gardens of
Mr. Buttet"&mdash;and Ayres paused as they
reached the lower end of town, speaking in
his usual oratorical style and with a sweep
of his hand toward the handsome brick house
to their left.  "From here we gain an
excellent view of the river&mdash;one of the
finest views in the United States, I may
say, sir.  Yonder you perceive Jeffersonville
in Indiana; a little to the left, the
magnificent falls of the Ohio.  Beyond this,
Clarksville and the Silver Creek hills, with
the forests and Rock Island completing the
panorama.  And just ahead of us, sir, an
interesting episode is about to be enacted,
if I mistake not."
</p>

<p>
Norton, who was paying little heed to the
view but much to what passed around him,
loosened his knife in its sheath; the
"interesting episode", he concluded swiftly, would
be enacted by something better than fists.
Lounging on the board walk a dozen yards
ahead, and eyeing him with insolent and
provocative glances, were two huge rivermen.
Both were idly whittling at small sticks, and
Norton had no doubt of their intent.
</p>

<p>
Fastening his eyes on the pair and already
angered by their insolent looks, he flung off
Ayres's restraining hand and stepped forward.
Then, however, something very odd took
place.
</p>

<p>
Swinging around the corner at which the
two rivermen stood, came three tow-clad
farmers with a snatch of drunken song.
One of them lurched heavily against the
nearer riverman, who shoved him away
with a snarling curse.
</p>

<p>
"Who&mdash;who you shovin'?" demanded the
farmer thickly.
</p>

<p>
"Git out, ye drunken fool," snapped the
big riverman angrily, his eye was still on
Norton.  "Move on&mdash;we ain't got time to
spend on ye."
</p>

<p>
"Whoop-ee!"&mdash;and the farmer gave vent
to a wild howl of rage.  "Hurray fer
Jefferson!  Damn the Democrats!  Shove me,
will ye?  I'll learn ye!  I'm a cross betwixt
a streak of chain-lightning and a bear-cat!  I
was sired by a thunderbolt an' riz by an
alligator an' I eats rattlers fer
breakfast&mdash;whoop-ee!"
</p>

<p>
With which peroration he gave the
riverman no chance for the usual exchange of
personal history, but with an astonishingly
accurate blow for a drunken man landed
his right on the riverman's jaw.  His two
companions instantly fell upon the second
riverman and with a whirlwind of blows
and dust and flashing knives and yells, all
five drove out into the street and left the
sidewalk clear.
</p>

<p>
"Come, sir"&mdash;and Norton felt Ayres pluck
his arm.  "They will lodge the two men in jail,
but we must not be detained as witnesses."
</p>

<p>
In a flash the real meaning of the scene
broke upon the Louisianian, and with a
grunt he strode off beside Ayres.  Something
most amazing must have happened in the
city of Louisville, he thought.  A week
previously, mention of Blacknose had been
enough to get a man his death; now, two
members of the mysterious gang were openly
assaulted in the streets!  His last view of the
combat, through the gathering crowd, showed
one of the farmers perched on the body of
a riverman and industriously gouging for
the eyes of his enemy in true border fashion.
</p>

<p>
Five minutes later Norton found himself
led toward a good-sized brick house which
stood back from the street amid spacious
gardens.  This, announced Ayres, belonged
to Mr. Tarascon, a prominent merchant,
who expected Norton as his guest.
Comprehending dimly that the schoolmaster must
have moved with tremendous activity in his
absence, the Louisianian strode up the steps
to be greeted quietly by a small elderly
Frenchman&mdash;no other than the owner of
the place.  He was unmarried, it appeared,
and when Norton addressed him in his own
tongue, he cried effusively that the house
no longer belonged to him but to his honoured
guest.  Moreover, the words were quite sincere.
</p>

<p>
The afternoon being practically over,
Tarascon and Ayres accompanied Norton
to his room&mdash;a spacious bedroom on the
ground floor, and there left him with a
darkie to attend his personal wants, and a
great variety of clothes to choose from.
With a sigh of relief, Norton bathed and
discarded his buckskin for a plum-coloured
suit; he was a gentleman once more in place
of a woods rover; and when he inspected
the cravat which the grinning darkie had
adjusted, he could scarce believe that at
daybreak he had been sitting in a canoe with
an acknowledged Indian-slayer, rifle in hand.
The day was far from done, however.  When
he was dressed, the negro ted him through
a dark corridor to two rooms blazing with
candles: one a dining-room of gigantic size,
the other an equally large music-room.  Still
blinking at the lights, Norton found his hand
gripped by Audubon and then perceived that
he had come into a gathering of men.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen, Captain John Norton!"
announced Mr. Tarascon, and turned,
smiling.  "Perhaps you had best introduce
our friends piecemeal, Mr. Audubon!"
</p>

<p>
A dozen men were present&mdash;Colonel Taylor,
Rosier, Ayres, and others of the Louisville
merchants to whom Audubon introduced
the Louisianian.  Colonel Boone had returned
home to Missouri, while Norton found that
his friend, Zach Taylor, had been ordered to
Vincennes to join General Harrison; barely
had he been made acquainted with all there,
however, when Colonel Taylor rose and with
a gesture obtained silence.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Norton"&mdash;and it was easy to see that
the old border fighter felt bitterly the shame
of his words&mdash;"when you were here last,
this town was in a peculiar state, sir.  As
you are only too well aware, the very name of
Blacknose spread terror; men were murdered
and property destroyed almost with impunity;
the secrecy of this gang of river-pirates and
its thorough organization seemed to hold us
all spellbound.  I acknowledge it with shame,
sir.  Then, with your coming, all this was
changed."
</p>

<p>
As Colonel Dick paused, Norton felt himself
the centre of attention.  He was himself too
interested in what was coming to heed this,
however, and merely nodded.
</p>

<p>
"You had barely arrived, Mr. Norton,
when an attempt was made upon your life;
a few hours later you were accused of a
dastardly murder and only the quick wit
of Mr. Ayres threw the pursuers from your
track.  We had given you up for lost, sir,
when Mr. Audubon returned to town and at
once communicated with Mr. Ayres.  The
result, you see here."
</p>

<p>
"I fancy I have seen the results before
this," smiled Norton drily, and told of the
encounter he had witnessed in town.  A
quick nod passed around.
</p>

<p>
"We can trust every man here," declared
Audubon quietly but impressively.  "The
grounds of this house are guarded by armed
men, Norton&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But how do you know <i>they</i> can all be
trusted?" demanded the Louisianian keenly.
</p>

<p>
"Because, sir," spoke up Ayres,
"Mr. Audubon and I enlisted them personally.
We went up-river and carefully selected only
those who had lost brothers or sons or fathers
with the boats which have vanished down the
river.  Every man of us here has sustained
heavy losses in property from the same
cause.  In short, sir, we have raised a
company of Regulators, with which to
exterminate this pestilent Blacknose gang."
</p>

<p>
Norton whistled to himself, eyeing the
energetic little schoolmaster in some admiration
as the whole thing broke over his mind.
So then, they were fighting secrecy with
secrecy, organization with organization!
</p>

<p>
Now he understood a good deal which
had mystified him&mdash;the words of Kitty
Grigg, the odd silence of his boatmen,
the manner in which the two bellicose
rivermen had been disposed of.  Ayres had
been swift and clever, also; by enlisting only
the relatives of the men who had disappeared
with their boats, during the past two years,
all possibility of treachery was removed
and the "Regulators" were certain to be
animated by a live hatred of Duval&mdash;but
did they know of Duval yet?  Norton flung
a quick glance around and found all waiting
for him to speak.  "How many here know
who Blacknose is, Audubon?"
</p>

<p>
The words were like a shock; Norton needed
no other answer to his question than the
startled questioning look which ran over
the faces in a flash.
</p>

<p>
"Only Ayres," returned the bird-lover,
gravely.  "It is a thing we cannot prove
definitely, and it would be much better to
destroy the whole gang at one blow.  We
will lay our suspicions before these friends
of ours to-night, and take counsel."
</p>

<p>
While Audubon was speaking, a white-haired
negro flung back the curtains which
shut off the dining-room, and now announced
dinner.  Mr. Tarascon rose.
</p>

<p>
"Then&mdash;you have ascertained something
definite, Mr. Norton?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  I may say that we have ascertained
everything."
</p>

<p>
In the startled silence all grouped themselves
about the long table, Norton sitting
between Tarascon and Ayres.  Then, while the
deft silent negro slaves waited upon them
and the long dinner was discussed, Norton
and Audubon related what they had overheard
on the bluff near the blazed cottonwood,
the Louisianian adding the conversation
between Grigg and Duval that same morning.
</p>

<p>
Being wealthy and very hospitable in a
land then noted for its inhospitality,
Mr. Tarascon had provided his best wines for
the occasion, both of French and Spanish.
In consequence, certain honest merchants,
who were more accustomed to home distilled
corn liquor, drank wisely but too well of the
rarer vintage; and no sooner had the two
friends finished their tale than the table
leaped into wild uproar.
</p>

<p>
For this, Norton was by no means sorry.
The issue came squarely forward; Was it
possible that Charles Duval could be in
alliance with such a gang of thieves and
pirates?  To many of those present it was
hard of credence; and one estimable old
merchant, who wore a high black stock, a red
peruke, and a coat cut in the fashion of the
nineties, arose and pounded the table in
vinuous indignation.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen, I refuse to believe this
monstrous concoction!" he roared fervidly.  "I
have known Charles Duval for ten years, and
I knew his father before him.  Our friend
and esteemed neighbour Henry Clay, now a
member of Congress, knows him&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Clay knows him?" broke in a loud
laugh from someone.  "Clay knocked him
down in front of the courthouse at Lexington
last summer&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I refuse to believe it!" continued he of
the black stock.  "This charge is not proven,
my friends.  I will go and bring Charles
Duval himself to deny it to your face&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
And shaking his fist, the angry old merchant
shoved back his chair and started for
the door.  Norton would have sprung up
to check him, but was restrained by Audubon's
hand; the others glanced at one another
in wondering fear, bewildered.  Were the
merchant to carry out his purpose, ruin was
certain to fall upon them; yet Tarascon only
sat at the head of the table and smiled as he
sipped his wine.  And, as the merchant
flung open the door, it was seen to be guarded
by a tall tow-clad man and barred by a
rifle.
</p>

<p>
"Sir&mdash;Mr. Tarascon&mdash;what means this!"
spluttered the merchant, turning.
</p>

<p>
"It means, sir, that my cellars are wide
and my caution is wider," returned the host
with only a veiled threat.  He smiled very
politely but his eyes were keen as he glanced
at the men who lined the table.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen," he went on quietly, "you
can readily understand that whether Mr.
Norton and Mr. Audubon are correct or not
in their suspicions, no word of what we are
about must come to Mr. Duval.  Each man
of you here to-night is a gentleman; before
you leave this house, you pass me your
words to that effect.  Else, you do not
leave.  It is very simple.  We are going
to stamp out this damnable river piracy,
and I promise you that every justice shall
be done Mr. Duval.  Sir, pray return to
your seat.  Boy, fetch that Oporto I had
from New Orleans last fall."
</p>

<p>
Norton, watching, perceived that he had
fallen among men of weight.  Tarascon was
obeyed by the angry merchant, amid a
grave silence, and Colonel Taylor was the
first to pledge his word to secrecy.  One by
one the others followed suit, after which
Elisha Ayres rose, pledged Norton's health
in his grandiloquent manner, and fell to
discussing the plan which he had already
elaborated with Audubon.
</p>

<p>
This plan of action needed co-operation
by the merchants there gathered, and it was
based upon Norton's own idea.  Brookfield's
horse-boat was to be chartered and laden
with a particularly valuable cargo, in which
lading each of the merchants should risk an
equal share.  Brookfield himself was a man
above suspicion, already enrolled in Ayres's
"Regulators", and willing to risk his craft
in the venture.
</p>

<p>
The boat would be another three weeks
in lading, or perhaps less.  Thus ample
time would be given Blacknose in which to
learn of its rich cargo and prepare an
ambuscade.  At Henderson the boat would secretly
pick up twenty of the "Regulators", who
would stow themselves below-decks in
readiness for an attack.
</p>

<p>
Norton was to ship openly as a passenger,
spreading abroad the report that his visit to
Louisville had been barren of results, and
in the meantime he was to remain as the
guest of Tarascon in Louisville.  Ayres drily
assured him that he would be well guarded.
With her rich cargo, the boat would be almost
certain to be attacked; all that was necessary
was for a prisoner or two to be made, in which
case they would turn State's evidence and
the rest of the gang could be hunted down
readily enough.
</p>

<p>
"Once we ascertain definitely who Blacknose
is," said Audubon, "we cut off the
whole affair.  Personally, I have no doubt
of the matter; but to those of you who cannot
believe Duval guilty, I would say&mdash;wait.
This whole matter must be conducted with
the greatest secrecy; let no hint of it get to
your slaves, for the gang no doubt has many
of our slaves in its pay."
</p>

<p>
"It's a good plan," stated Norton
thoughtfully, frowning.  "Almost too good, my
friends.  We must not overplay our hand&mdash;do
not say too much about the rich cargo,
for example.  Duval, or Blacknose, is no
fool!  The thing seems all cut and dried,
and that is why I fear&mdash;well, wait and see.
When the time comes, we can show no mercy;
that gang is pitiless, more savage than the
redskins, and from the moment Brookfield's
boat casts off her moorings at Shippingsport
it becomes a war to the knife.  Well,
gentlemen"&mdash;and with a smile he rose, glass in
hand&mdash;"for the rest of this evening let us
cast care aside, and so allow me to propose
a toast to the gentleman whose wig sets
awry over a very excellent set of
brains&mdash;Mr. Elisha Ayres, gentlemen!"
</p>

<p>
And the toast was drunk standing, while
the little schoolmaster wriggled in huge
delight and tried to straighten his greasy
wig.  None the less, Norton remained thoughtful
that evening&mdash;for he could not forget
the girl with gold-red hair whose hand had
come to his lips that day, and whose gage
he wore inside his shirt.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap11"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
</h3>

<p>
As Norton had thought, Mr. Elisha Ayres
had formulated a plan which was almost too
good.  During the week following the meeting
at Tarascon's house, he found that what
appeared excellent by candlelight looked
somewhat full of shreds and patches by the
cold light of day.
</p>

<p>
The Regulators, to be sure, were unobtrusive
but efficient, numbering twenty, and
neither the Tarascon house nor Norton
himself was ever unguarded.  No more attempts
were made upon Norton; yet the day after
that dinner-party a brawl took place in the
"Steuben Arms" in which one of the
Regulators and a settler from down near the
Wabash managed to kill each other.  The
settler seemed unknown in the town, which
was a significant fact.
</p>

<p>
"Public sentiment is rising, sir," observed
Audubon on hearing of it from Ayres, as
they walked with Norton in the Tarascon
gardens next day.  "I would imagine that
Duval is caught napping.  Most of his men
are down-river with Grigg, beyond a doubt,
and while he must be perfectly aware of
something going on, he is helpless.  Further,
he is engaged in court at Lexington."
</p>

<p>
During that idle week Norton might have
gone to Cincinnati had not Brookfield been
expecting to get away soon.  The lading of
his boat and the repair of her paddles had
gone forward faster than had been looked
for, and now the rivermen hoped in all
confidence to be off before the following week was
up.  His crew consisted of six men only,
and he could trust but two of them.
</p>

<p>
"Set the departure for next Saturday,
then," commanded Norton, as he and Ayres
and Audubon consulted with Brookfield on
the Monday.  "Give our friend Duval time
to make his preparations, for we must make
sure of all.  On Friday send the Regulators
down the river on horseback so that they can
pass Henderson before daybreak and pick
us up near Diamond Island."
</p>

<p>
On the table was a chart of the Ohio, and
Audubon broke in, placing his finger on the
Wabash settlement.
</p>

<p>
"You mind the settler who was slain last
week?  He came from this settlement, and
must have been one of Duval's men.  There
is a clue for us; besides, Grigg and Duval
agreed to waylay the boat near the Wabash."
</p>

<p>
The others nodded soberly.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Norton's idea is very good," said
Ayres.  "Captain Brookfield, set your
departure for the Saturday morning.  It is
only a hundred miles to Henderson by trail,
and we will send out the Regulators Friday;
they will pick you up here at Diamond
Island, twelve miles below Henderson, on
the Kentucky shore beyond the plantation
of Mr. Alvis."
</p>

<p>
To this Brookfield agreed.  He would reach
the island some time on Sunday, and the
Regulators would thus have plenty of time
to make the journey by land, avoiding
Henderson itself.  So, with all plans fully
settled, there was naught to do save to wait
and watch.
</p>

<p>
Captain Brookfield announced his departure
and rushed his lading, and with that
the situation began to tighten up, Duval,
having been engaged in court at Ledington
for two days, returned to town on Wednesday;
and Norton saw that with his return the
lawyer had taken swift warning of some sort.
</p>

<p>
The plot was known to a dozen citizens at
most, and the little border town remained
as quiet and sleepy as ever; but beneath the
surface there was a furious boiling of the pot.
Since the double killing at the "Steuben
Arms," the Regulators had been forbidden
the tavern.  Now, however, Duval openly
made the place his headquarters.  He had
a plantation a few miles up-river, it seemed,
but stopped at the tavern when in town.
And on the Wednesday, Norton found the
trap ready laid for his bait.
</p>

<p>
He had been riding below the falls with
Audubon, and on their return they rode
past the "Steuben Arms".  As they jogged
along, Norton saw a negro step into the tavern
courtyard and loose a bird from a small
wicker cage.  At the action, he caught his
friend's arms swiftly.
</p>

<p>
"That bird&mdash;watch it!  What is it?"
</p>

<p>
Audubon whistled, and watched the bird
as it circled up to pick its course, and finally
shot off to the westward.  He took out his
pocket-compass, inspected it, then quietly
beckoned Norton to ride on.
</p>

<p>
"Southwest by west and a half west,"
he returned, a flush of excitement on his
high cheeks.  "A carrier pigeon for the
Wabash, Norton!  Now ends all mystery,
and the stage-players can no more fool
the audience."
</p>

<p>
"By gad!" breathed Norton softly, his
brown eyes flaming out at Audubon.  "He
uses carrier pigeons, eh?  Then Duval must
be concocting his plan against the
horse-boat with Grigg and the gang&mdash;and if we
could but bring down one of those pigeons
we could nip him like a flea!"
</p>

<p>
"Good," nodded the other.  "Let us come
out to-morrow morning, with that little
double-barrelled gun of mine.  The birds
will not fly too high, I think."
</p>

<p>
So it came about that Norton went back
to his woods garments with the next
morning.  Tarascon's slaves had greased his
old buckskins, so that the stiffness was gone
from them and Norton donned them and
his fine moccasins with a feeling of joy.
At breakfast he confided to Tarascon what
his mission was.
</p>

<p>
"If we bring down a bird and find a
message," he concluded, "we had best jail
Duval at once."
</p>

<p>
The other nodded quietly, his dark eyes
sparkling.
</p>

<p>
"One of my slaves informed me this morning,"
he returned, "that Duval was preparing
for a journey&mdash;though I had said nothing to
any of my slaves.  But trust the darkies to
know what's afoot!"
</p>

<p>
"It's a poor sword that has not two edges,"
said Norton, frowning.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly&mdash;that is just what we risk,
Mr. Norton," and Tarascon departed
gloomily to his business.
</p>

<p>
Norton rode out, met Audubon and Ayres,
and the three wended west of town with
rifles ready.  All that day their watching
proved vain, however, for no pigeon passed
overhead save for a flock of wild birds.  This
was on the Thursday, and the horse-boat
was to sail on the Saturday.
</p>

<p>
With the next morning all three were out
again, and still came no result.  The
Regulators left Louisville that morning&mdash;twenty
of them, all mounted and armed,
with instructions to meet the boat at Diamond
Island, twelve miles below Henderson.  All
day the three friends watched from the
riverside, but no pigeon appeared, and with the
evening Norton gave up all hope of thus
cornering Duval.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Ayres and Audubon returned to the
Tarascon house for dinner.  During the
meal, their host was summoned outside and
returned, leading a badly-frightened slave.
</p>

<p>
"News, my friends!" cried Tarascon
eagerly.  "This boy is one of the hostlers
at the "Steuben Arms", and I have paid him
to keep an eye on Duval&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"It's a poor sword that hasn't two edges,"
broke in Norton glumly.
</p>

<p>
"Confound it, cease your croaking!"
exclaimed Audubon gaily.  "Out with the
news, Tarascon!  Don't heed him."
</p>

<p>
Tarascon smiled and settled into his seat,
white the negro waited, rolling his eyes in
fright until the merchant tossed him a
dollar.
</p>

<p>
"Now, boy, you say Mr. Duval is leaving
to-morrow?"
</p>

<p>
"Yas, suh.  He done got three hosses
waitin' foh him."
</p>

<p>
"Making ready for a quick trip, eh?"
said Ayres.  The merchant nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Have you overheard anything about his
plans, boy?"
</p>

<p>
"Yas, suh.  Ah done heard him talkin'
wif a man.  He reckoned they was gwine
to beat Cap'n Brookfield's boat to
Henderson, suh."
</p>

<p>
"Two of them, eh?  Anything more?"
</p>

<p>
"No, suh."
</p>

<p>
Upon this, Tarascon dismissed the slave,
and the four friends discussed the news.
They finally reached the conclusion that Duval
intended to meet the pirates and take part in
the attack on the horse-boat, after which he
would doubtless flee the country, as he must
know that there was something afoot.
</p>

<p>
"So much the better," cried Audubon gaily.
"Success to the Regulators!"
</p>

<p>
"All very well," retorted Norton.  "But
I don't like this slave business.  What
we can do, Duval can do."
</p>

<p>
His forebodings were drowned in Oporto,
however.  Next morning the four again
gathered at breakfast, after which all mounted
and rode through town toward Shippingsport
to see Norton off.  It was early, and few
people were astir, for Brookfield was making
a swift trip to Henderson and wanted to
make the most of the day.  As they passed the
"Steuben Arms," Norton sent a casual glance
at the place; then he reined in suddenly.
</p>

<p>
His quick eye had caught sight of a negro
just emerging on the courtyard, a wicker
cage in his hand.  With a sudden thrill of
excitement, he spurred from the road and
clattered down on the startled slave.  The
cage held a pigeon.
</p>

<p>
"Give me that bird, boy," he said, leaning
over.
</p>

<p>
"Dishyer bird b' longs to Mr. Duval,
suh"&mdash;and the darkie drew back.  The
other three had followed Norton, however,
and hemmed in the slave so that his escape
to the doorway behind was cut off.
</p>

<p>
"Watch him, Audubon!" cried Norton.
</p>

<p>
Without further parley he leaned down
and grasped the cage from the shrinking
negro.  Opening it eagerly, he found a
tiny slip of paper under the bird's wing,
and carefully loosened it.
</p>

<p>
A glance around showed him three saddled
horses to one side, and he knew they had been
just in time.  Then, unfolding the paper,
he read the message written thereon.  It
was unsigned.
</p>

<p class="letter">
A.G.&mdash;
<br /><br />
Meet me as planned.  B's boat leaves
to-day.  Have arranged all satisfactorily.
Norton goes with boat.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Silently he passed the note to Ayres, and
the others crowded together over it, while the
negro watched in affright.  Ayres looked up.
</p>

<p>
"It is Duval's hand," he said, his voice
quivering with excitement.  "What's to be
done?"
</p>

<p>
"Seize him," said Norton curtly.
"Mr. Tarascon, will you go on to the port
and tell Brookfield that I will meet him
at Diamond Island instead of going with
him from here?  Ayres, there is no court
in session now?"
</p>

<p>
"No," returned the schoolmaster.  "What
would you do?"
</p>

<p>
"Take care of Duval, then ride to Henderson
and catch the boat," snapped Norton,
as the plan of action took rapid shape in
his brain.  "Gentlemen, we must bring out
our charges in public and lay Duval by the
heels, thus cutting off the head of the gang.
Ayres, do you hasten and collect our friends
and others at the courthouse, in the
court-room.  Audubon and I will fetch Duval.
Off with you, now!"
</p>

<p>
There was a moment of startled silence
as all four realized that now indeed the
crisis had come.  Then Tarascon wheeled
his horse, Ayres followed suit, and the two
swept out of the courtyard at a gallop.
Norton and Audubon dismounted.
</p>

<p>
"Take us to the chambers of Mr. Duval, boy."
</p>

<p>
The negro obeyed, trembling with fear,
and the two men followed him through the
tavern to Duval's room, there dismissing
him.  In response to their knock, the lawyer
himself, plainly astonished, opened the door.
He was dressed for a journey, with pistols
at his belt, and Norton surveyed him with
a grim smile.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Duval, some time ago you proffered
me your services did I desire to draw up
my will.  That time has come, and as I
can find no other lawyer and am in some
haste, I beg of you to serve me."
</p>

<p>
Duval was puzzled.  He looked into
Norton's grim eyes, then at Audubon, and
one hand rested on the pistol at his side.
</p>

<p>
"Do you jest, sir?" he asked coldly,
</p>

<p>
"I do not jest with you," returned Norton.
Then the hatred within him burst all bounds,
and he suddenly flung up his rifle.  "Curse
you, Duval, we've got you!  Out of there!"
</p>

<p>
His flint was up, and Duval knew better
than to resist.  He came out into the passage,
coldly insolent.
</p>

<p>
"This time you have gone too far,
Mr. Norton.  I follow you, but you
shall&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You do not follow&mdash;you go before,"
snarled Norton.  "Guide him, Audubon.
I'll keep him covered."
</p>

<p>
In Norton's heart was wild triumph.  No
sooner had they left the tavern than a crowd
began to assemble; while Audubon went
on with Duval, the Louisianian took their
horses in hand and followed, his rifle covering
the lawyer ahead.
</p>

<p>
Ayres had already stirred the town into
wild excitement, and now Norton perceived
a fresh danger as the crowd lagged on their
heels.  Were it made public that Duval
was none other than Blacknose, the man
would be mobbed instantly, and this must
be prevented at all costs.  He was relieved
to see Tarascon, returning from the port,
break through the wondering crowd and
clatter to his side.
</p>

<p>
"Ride on," he said swiftly to the merchant.
"Station guards at the courthouse doors.
This affair must not be taken out of our
hands.  Allow only prominent citizens in
the courtroom&mdash;ah, there is Colonel Taylor!"
</p>

<p>
Taylor, it appeared, had ridden into town
to see Norton off, and joined them in some
wonder at the scene as Tarascon departed.
It was well he did, for the crowd, seeing
that Norton held Duval a prisoner, was
uttering threats and gathering courage to
rescue the supposed victim of an assault.
</p>

<p>
The presence of Taylor held them quiet,
and so the procession came to the
courthouse.  Duval must have known that his
time had come, but he walked very proudly,
without a word.  Men were streaming into
the courthouse, and at the door stood
Tarascon, Ayres, and two men with rifles
who pressed back the crowd.  Two more
appeared to take charge of Duval, though
in some bewilderment.
</p>

<p>
Entering the courtroom itself, Norton
strode to the judge's bench and faced the
assemblage, his friends beside him.  Duval was
held at the opposite side of the room.  To his
surprise, Norton found the crowd very quiet,
very grave, almost to fear.  One and all
were citizens of weight and prominence.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Quietly, the Louisianian addressed them
and charged Duval with being the mysterious
Blacknose, relating all his former evidence
and finally reading out the note.  After
one startled gasp, the men facing him sat
quietly and listened while Audubon and
Ayres sustained the charges.
</p>

<p>
Through it all Duval stood immobile,
until at length Norton looked at him and
asked if he had anything to say.  Then the
lawyer drew himself up arrogantly.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen"&mdash;and the deep timbre of
his voice rang out proudly as all faces
turned to him&mdash;"do you not perceive how
ridiculous is this charge?  Need I say more?"
</p>

<p>
To his amazement, Norton found that the
words met with silence&mdash;a silence partly of
wonder, partly of doubt.  Duval was very
calm, very powerful, holding the assemblage
by the sheer force of his personality and
will.  Then a man leaped to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Confound it, sir," he cried at Duval,
"explain that note!  Explain why&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;explain?" broke in Duval ringingly.
"Guilty men explain; I do not!  Have you
not seen that this Mr. Norton hates and
fears me?  Did not his bitterness ring through
every word he spoke?  My friends, I have
lived among you all my life; some of you
are my clients and know me well.  If you
can think that I would thus deal with you
then I wash my hands of you, and my blood
be on your heads!"
</p>

<p>
Dismayed though he was, Norton could
not but admire the keen spirit of the man.
Duval knew he was lost, yet was making
a desperate fight&mdash;for what?  A word of
explanation and the crowd would have been
at his throat; instead, he defied them and
they doubted everything.
</p>

<p>
A wild storm of voices arose, and as
Tarascon began to quiet it for a hearing,
Norton saw Duval take a slow backward step.
The lawyer's hands were on his pistols, and in
a flash Norton caught the man's intent.
</p>

<p>
"Stop him!" he shouted, but the words
were lost.
</p>

<p>
Quick as a cat, Duval had seized the
right moment.  Whirling on the two men
who guarded him, he sent one staggering
with his fist; the other he shot through
the body.  As the roar of the pistol crashed
out and the doorway was hidden by smoke,
Norton leaped forward.
</p>

<p>
Fighting his way through the maddened
crowd of cursing shouting men, he won
to the door and sprang through the corridor
to the outer doorway, Audubon at his heels.
Too late!  He caught another pistol-shot
and saw Duval galloping away down the
street like mad.
</p>

<p>
Norton flung up his rifle and fired from
the steps, over the heads of the shouting
crowd, who were scattering in alarm.  Duval's
steed gave a leap, but the lawyer pressed
him onward; the next instant a surge of
men swept up and the mob met those
crowding out from the courthouse.
</p>

<p>
"Blacknose!  Duval is Blacknose!"
</p>

<p>
A wild savage yell shrilled up at the
words.  At the same instant Norton felt
Audubon's hand on his arm.
</p>

<p>
"Out the back way!" said the bird-lover
excitedly.  "We will get horses and after him.
Ayres has gone for the steeds.  Quickly!"
</p>

<p>
And cursing all things in his bitterness,
Norton turned and fought clear of the crowd.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
</h3>

<p>
Within a short half-hour of Duval's
dramatic&mdash;and tragic&mdash;escape from the
courthouse, Norton and Audubon were at the
head of a dozen well-mounted men, led
horses with them, and they left Louisville
at a gallop along the post road.
</p>

<p>
Duval, it was learned, had gained the
"Steuben Arms" and had then galloped off
with his three horses, one other man with
him&mdash;a riverman, who was evidently of the gang.
</p>

<p>
Behind, the town was in a ferment, but
Norton galloped along in grim silence.  In
his party were Ayres, Tarascon, and Colonel
Dick Taylor; all had steeds of the best
and all were driven by the same flame of
rage which burned in Norton's heart.
</p>

<p>
Yet not the same.  Norton knew they
must catch Duval before Henderson was
reached, in order that the gang might
have no warning; but he was thinking
more of Kitty Grigg than of the gang itself.
Did Duval get away, he would doubtless
carry out the attack on the horse-boat,
and the gang would then scatter with their
loot.  At least, such would be the intention,
for so far as Norton knew, Duval was ignorant
of the plot to trap the gang; nothing had
been said of it at the courthouse.
</p>

<p>
The fourteen men galloped along the post
road toward Sullivan's ferry, and there was
no sparing of horseflesh that morning.
Norton set a terrific pace, and with a thunder
of hoofs they swept into the little settlement
at the ferry and found Sullivan himself.
</p>

<p>
"Two men and three horses&mdash;which way?"
</p>

<p>
"Henderson road, twenty minutes since,"
shouted Sullivan.  "What's the matter?"
</p>

<p>
"Blacknose!  Duval is Blacknose!"
</p>

<p>
With the yell, Norton dug in his moccasined
heels and once more they galloped
away, leaving the ferryman staring after
them in wild surmise.  The lawyer had a
good start, and his horses were of the best.
</p>

<p>
With the thought of Kitty Grigg pounding
at his heart in time with the thunder of
hoofs behind, Norton rode on like a
madman.  Did Duval escape, the girl would
be in his power.
</p>

<p>
"He shall not escape," vowed Norton
inwardly.  "Faster!"
</p>

<p>
And again he urged his mount to fresh
efforts, his led horse pounding at his side.
Behind, the fourteen were strung out along
the uneven blazed trail in frantic pursuit.
</p>

<p>
They were following a "trace" which
struck southwest to avoid the windings of
the river, for it was thus that their quarry had
gone.  The road was not worthy the name,
yet was the shortest route to Henderson.
</p>

<p>
"Hold up, man&mdash;hold up!" came the
voice of Audubon.  "You'll kill our steeds
at this rate!"
</p>

<p>
"When they die, your led horses remain,"
flung back Norton, and dug in his heels
once more.  His beast was white with foam
already, but held to its steady gallop; all
the horses were finely bred, out of the best
blue-grass country around Louisville, and
could be depended on till the last.
</p>

<p>
Without slacking the mad gait, Norton
drew in his second horse; flinging his leg
over the saddle, he changed seats successfully.
It was a splendid bit of horsemanship,
but his followers could not emulate it.
</p>

<p>
"Hold up, Norton!" roared Taylor.  "Wait
for us to change&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I'm after Duval," he retorted, and
looked around.  "Let the rest wait!"
</p>

<p>
Half the fourteen were already drawing
rein, preparing to change their mounts;
Audubon alone swung to his spare horse
at full gallop, and pounded on with a ringing
laugh.
</p>

<p>
Five minutes later Norton saw a man
standing in the road ahead, and drew in
slightly.  The man was a settler, watching
them in staring wonder.
</p>

<p>
"Anyone passed?" flung out Norton,
pulling up.
</p>

<p>
"Two men&mdash;three horses, fifteen minutes
since," came the answer.  "What's gwine
on&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
"After them!" shouted Norton, and
loosened his reins.
</p>

<p>
Mile after mile wound past.  They were
in the full wilderness now, the "trace"
being nothing but a rudely blazed trail
winding amid girdled trees and short stumps.
Settlers were scarce and the road was little
travelled, but as Norton whipped into a
branch and leaned down, he could see
hoof-marks in the soil beneath him, and the
sight lent him fresh eagerness.
</p>

<p>
A yell and a crash from behind made
him twist about in the saddle.  Two of his
men had smashed together and gone down
in a mad heap; another plunged full into
them; the rest leaped clear.  It required
skill to follow that road at full speed, but
Norton never slackened.
</p>

<p>
Ever at his flank rode Audubon, rifle on
saddle, while Ayres and Taylor followed
next.  Tarascon had fallen behind; looking
back after a little, Norton saw the merchant's
horse falling, and sent back a wild
laugh.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Sauve qui peut</i>!  After them!"
</p>

<p>
Twenty miles on their way, and still ten
men rode with Norton as he topped a crest
and swung down toward a dipping bowl
of bottom-land, strewn with canebrakes.
Even as he glimpsed the danger, Audubon
shouted:
</p>

<p>
"'Ware, Norton!  They've fired the canes!"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
A low drift of smoke was rising from the
road below where it struck through a patch
of canes.  Norton saw it, but sent his horse
onward in grim resolve.  The fire was newly
started; five minutes later and they must
have gone around through the swamps.
</p>

<p>
His staring-eyed horse never faltered
beneath his hand, but went driving at the
smoke-veil.  The led beast tried to tug
free and all but tore the Louisianian from
his saddle, but he dragged savagely on the
reins and all went well.  One horrible
choking moment, and they were through;
on the rising ground beyond, he drew up
and again changed saddles.
</p>

<p>
Ayres and Audubon followed, then Colonel
Taylor, whose spare beast had broken away.
Four more came through, but as a puff
of wind lifted the smoke Norton could see
the rest vainly trying to drive their maddened
steeds at the fire.  He laughed a little.
</p>

<p>
"After them!  Duval can't last at this pace!"
</p>

<p>
Ten minutes later Taylor's horse foundered
and the old border fighter fell behind,
swearing volubly.  Now there were but
six men after Norton, and a little later
they perceived how desperate was Duval's
plight when they came upon a dying horse
in the road, still saddled.
</p>

<p>
"After them!" shouted Norton again.
</p>

<p>
Duval and his companion had but three
horses at the start, and had killed one of
those; with luck, the chase would now be
short.  Norton's steeds were both white
with foam, trembling as they pounded
onward, but there was good distance in them
yet, and his changes kept them fairly
freshened.
</p>

<p>
Still the miles thundered behind them,
and now there were but five men at his
heels, for one had gone down.  Audubon
shouted out as they dipped down toward
another canebrake.
</p>

<p>
"Five miles more and we get fresh
horses!  There's a tavern where they keep
changes&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
His words were drowned in a scream
from one of the men close behind.  Up
from the canebrake a hundred yards ahead
drifted a little fleck of white; in the road
lay a struggling horse.
</p>

<p>
"Run to earth!" yelled Norton, never
looking back at the man who dragged in his
stirrup, shot through the heart.  "On them!"
</p>

<p>
He knew his mistake the next moment,
however.  Duval was not run to earth yet;
it was his companion whose horse had gone
down, and who had thus tempted fate.
Norton went into the canes with a wild
leap; he plunged on the riverman before
the latter could reload.
</p>

<p>
The riverman, a tall bearded scoundrel,
flashed up a pistol at Norton and the bullet
flew through his hair.  The Louisianian
rode him down; the horse stumbled at the
impact, and Norton went over the brute's
head into the muck.  Rising, he heard a
rifle bang out and caught his steed's bridle
over the relaxing body of the riverman.
Ayres lowered his rifle, white-faced.
</p>

<p>
"No hurt," cried Norton.  "After him!"
</p>

<p>
Remounting, he caught his other horse
and pounded on, his sole thought a savage
desire to get at Duval.  Besides Audubon
and Ayres, but two others were left; one
of these was mired a mile farther on, and
they swept away from him before he could
change beasts.
</p>

<p>
Good though the horses were, they were
staggering terribly.  The Louisianian was
wild with impotent rage; he knew well
that Duval would secure a fresh mount at
the tavern ahead, and would get the best.
With a frenzy of curses he drove on his
steed, let his spare horse drop behind, saw
Ayres pull up with a cry of despair, and
thundered on over the last mile, hoping
against hope.
</p>

<p>
And all in vain.  The tavern was a low
building set in a clearing, barns and tobacco
sheds behind, and just beyond was a clump
of settlers' cabins.  As they came in sight
of the place, still a half-mile distant,
Norton had plain sight of a figure riding
from the tavern at full gallop.  With a
groan he turned a drawn face to Audubon.
</p>

<p>
"How far to Henderson?"
</p>

<p>
"Fifty miles&mdash;we have come half-way,
and the day is dying."
</p>

<p>
With a start, Norton perceived that the
afternoon was indeed well forward.  While the
reeling horses galloped on, he turned to
the bird-lover and directed him to secure
fresh beasts.
</p>

<p>
"We'll get food and eat it later"&mdash;and
he nodded toward the remaining man, a
Scotch farmer from above Louisville.  The
latter grunted, and so they swept up to
the squalid tavern.
</p>

<p>
Its proprietor, an open-mouthed, staring
person, met their quick demands with a
slow shake of the head, watching them slip
to the ground.  Before he could reply to
them, Norton had shoved him aside with
an impatient oath and strode on into the
tavern, the Scotch farmer at his heels.
</p>

<p>
In the kitchens out behind the main
building they found negro slaves at work,
and amid frightened screams Norton seized
what food was in sight.  Flinging down a
dollar in payment, Norton led the way back.
</p>

<p>
Negroes were already leading out half a dozen
horses from a near-by pasture while Audubon
pacified the tavern-keeper with a gold-piece.
In five minutes the saddles were transferred,
and the three set out at a breakneck gallop
on their new mounts, eating as they rode.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The difference in horses was instantly
apparent to Norton.  Although he urged
the beasts relentlessly, when darkness fell
they had caught no further glimpse of Duvai.
Even his desperate frenzy was forced to
give way before the gathering shadows.
</p>

<p>
"Hold up or you'll be brained," cried
Audubon as a bough nearly took Norton out
of the saddle.  "This is rank madness, man!"
</p>

<p>
The Louisianian refused to listen, but
pressed on.  Five minutes later his horse went
down in a mud-hole, its leg broken, while he
himself received a nasty fall against a stump.
</p>

<p>
Sobered by the pain and the shaking-up, he
shot the poor beast and mounted his spare
steed, riding on at a slower pace and in gloomy
silence For an hour the three proceeded more
slowly, until a glimmering against the horizon
announced the rising moon.
</p>

<p>
"Duval is in the same boat," observed
Audubon.  "We can be sure that he'll keep
the trail, for it's his only hope."
</p>

<p>
Norton did not reply.  Duval must keep
to the "trace" indeed; unless he passed
Henderson ahead of them he was lost.  His
only hope lay in meeting his own gang
or else in getting down the river ahead of
his pursuers by means of a boat or canoe.
</p>

<p>
When the moon came up at length, Norton
renewed the chase at a gallop, and the
freshened horses responded nobly to his
urgings.  It was sheer madness to go sweeping
through the dark woods at that pace, but
Norton was far past caring.
</p>

<p>
"Kitty Grigg!  Kitty Grigg!"
</p>

<p>
The name pounded through his heart with
the pound of the hoofs on the dew-wet turf.
He was just changing saddles at midnight,
when the Scotchman drew up alongside, spent.
</p>

<p>
"Take my fresh horse, Mr Norton.  This
beastie o' mine is done, and I'll be done,
too, in anither hour."
</p>

<p>
Norton nodded, and with a word to
Audubon, rode on.  Out of all the fourteen
who had thundered out of Louisville, he
and his friend alone were left.  To judge from
his own stiffened and wearied body, Audubon
must be made of iron to stand the pace.
</p>

<p>
With three led horses, they did not spare
the brutes while the moonlight lasted, one
of the mounts foundering an hour later.  At
last the moon died into the darkness preceding
dawn, and with only the horses they rode
left to them, they drew up for a brief rest.
</p>

<p>
"We must be hard on Henderson," said
Norton shortly, lighting his pipe, for he
would not sleep.
</p>

<p>
"Ten miles from there, I think," responded
Audubon "There's a fork in the trail
somewhere ahead.  One trace goes to Henderson;
the other proceeds to the river near
Diamond Island, I believe."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
With the first gleam of grey in the sky,
they were up and off; and now as the
daylight increased, Norton again urged the
poor steeds to the utmost.
</p>

<p>
An hour after dawn Audubon halted him
with a shout, and just beyond them he
perceived that the trail bent around to the
north, a fainter trail continuing from it
to the left and west.  He pulled up and
dismounted stiffly.
</p>

<p>
"By gad!  Audubon, which trail for Henderson?"
</p>

<p>
"The northern."
</p>

<p>
"Then we've got him!  He's gone on to
strike the river, and here are the marks
where the Regulators turned off to Henderson
yesterday!"
</p>

<p>
Norton leaped into his saddle and his
jaded steed again took up the road.  The
other horse was spent, however.  A mile
farther on, and Norton turned at a cry to
see Audubon go down.
</p>

<p>
"I'm done!" shouted Audubon, scrambling
to his feet.  "On, Norton!  Good luck!"
</p>

<p>
For a bare instant the Louisianian hesitated,
then dug in his heels and sent his
sobbing beast ahead, his face grim.
Everything now depended on him alone.
</p>

<p>
It was Sunday morning, he knew, and
he wondered if there were any church-bells
in Henderson.  His horse was staggering
now, and he had to watch closely lest he
be sent headlong into the trees.
</p>

<p>
The Regulators had arrived at Henderson
yesterday, according to the trail.  No doubt
they had passed through town or avoided
it, going on along the river-bank to Diamond
Island, where there was a large plantation.
Then, with the miles slipping behind, Norton
caught a gleam of water ahead and greeted
it with a hoarse shout.  The Ohio!
</p>

<p>
His beast coughed, straddled out, and
sagged down.  Norton slipped to the ground,
rifle in hand, and with stiffened, stumbling
feet ran forward, pouring a fresh priming
in the pan as he ran.  Where were the
Regulators?  Where was Duval?  Where was
Red Hugh?  Had the wilderness trail
swallowed them all?
</p>

<p>
Gasping and sobbing for breath, he followed
the faint track to the water's edge,
broke out from the last trees, and found
himself on the river's brink.  Then he uttered
a groan of dismay and sank down, panting.
Far down the stream, with a single man
paddling furiously, was a canoe; as he
looked, it swept around the lower end of
the island and vanished.
</p>

<p>
Duval had escaped.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Slowly Norton pulled himself together.
Twenty feet away was a horse, gasping out
its life beside the river; Duval must have
known where a canoe lay cached.  From
where he was, Norton had an excellent view
of Diamond Island and the river.
</p>

<p>
He was a mile below the ferry and the
upper end of the island, which was
diamond-shaped.  Henderson lay twelve miles
up-river.  The island, partly timbered and
partly under cultivation, was four miles in
length, and the stream in front of Norton
was a quarter of a mile in width.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, staggering a little, he sprang
to his feet.  Up the river he had made out
a shape impossible to mistake; Brookfield's
horse-boat was floating down the swift
current, keeping close to the Kentucky
shore, and it was a scant half-mile above&mdash;he
had come just in the nick of time, then!
</p>

<p>
Norton remembered that the boat was
to have started from Henderson that morning,
and also that Red Hugh had promised to
meet it near the head of Diamond Island.
Was he aboard, then, with the Regulators?
</p>

<p>
Norton watched the ungainly craft as it
came down.  He saw sweeps put out and
knew that he had been observed, for the
craft slowly forged in toward him.  Brookfield
was standing in the bow, and beside him
was a tall figure which Norton recognized
with a thrill of wild relief.  Red Hugh had
kept his word!
</p>

<p>
Slowly the craft neared the bank, and
Norton waded out through the shallows to
meet her.  At length he came near enough
to grip the hand of Red Hugh and so
clambered up over the rail as the crew pushed
the boat out again.  For a moment he sat
helpless, weak and unstrung, looking around.
He saw the six men of the crew, but there
was no sign of the Regulators.
</p>

<p>
"All is well?" he asked hoarsely as
Brookfield strode over and helped him to his
feet.  "Have the Regulators come aboard?"
</p>

<p>
"All is well&mdash;but what mean you about
the Regulators?" queried the other, in
seeming surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Eh?"  Norton stared at him, tottering
at the knees and clutching at Red Hugh
for support.  "Are you crazed?  They were
to have met you at the island&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Your pardon, sir, but I have Mr Ayres's
writing otherwise"&mdash;and Brookfield hastily
produced a folded paper.  Norton took it,
still a-stare, trying to pull himself together
and meet the situation.
</p>

<p>
"By gad, sir, one of us must be mad,
then!" he broke out, and turned on Red
Hugh.  "What's all this, Hugh?  Where
did you get aboard?"
</p>

<p>
"A mile up-stream, by the ferry."
</p>

<p>
"For God's sake, sir," broke in the
captain, terrible fear on his countenance,
"read that note which Ayres sent me at
Henderson!"
</p>

<p>
"He sent you none," cried Norton wildly,
and opened the paper.  He saw the same
writing which he had seen in the note taken
from the carrier-pigeon&mdash;the writing of
Charles Duval, though the note was signed
by another name.
</p>

<p class="letter">
Captain Brookfield.
<br /><br />
Sir:&mdash;The plans are changed.  The
Regulators will not come aboard your
boat but will follow after in a skiff.
Do you proceed and leave all to me.
<br /><br />
ELISHA AYRES.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Norton looked up, and all things were in
a haze before his eyes.  Dimly he realized
that there had been awful treachery
somewhere; dimly he remembered how he had
warned Tarascon against the slaves.  He
tried to speak, but only a hoarse murmur
came from his lips.
</p>

<p>
Duval had tricked them&mdash;tricked them!
He had known their plot all along and had
set a counterplot with devilish ingenuity;
this note must have been waiting at
Henderson for a day or two&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
With a terrible effort to warn Brookfield,
Norton screamed out something and fell in
a heap as his knees gave way.  The strain
and the shock had mastered him, and he
lay senseless on the deck while the others
stared, ignorant of what had chanced, and
the horse-boat swept on down-stream.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
</h3>

<p>
A trickle of whisky through his lips
brought Norton to his senses.  A terrible
lassitude had come upon him, but he shook
it off with an effort and sat up in the arms
of Red Hugh.
</p>

<p>
Brookfield was standing, watching him,
biting at his moustache in anxiety.  Behind
them Diamond Island was fast slipping into
the distance, while the boat's crew was
watching Norton from afar, curiously.  He
looked out at the three-mile stretch of wide
river, saw the clustered settlements which
lined the banks on the opposite shore, and
then&mdash;remembered.
</p>

<p>
"That letter was forged," he said slowly,
striving to force himself into coherent calm.
Brookfield jumped at the word.
</p>

<p>
"Forged&mdash;impossible!" he returned
swiftly.  "Why, Mr. Norton, I met two
of the Regulators at Henderson last night,
and they themselves said they had been
recalled by Mr. Ayres and yourself&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Duped!" murmured Norton, and compressed
his lips.  Duval had sent another
note to the Regulators, then!  Had probably
sent it days ahead!
</p>

<p>
The whole thing now lay plain before his
mind.  Cunning as a fox, Duval had known
of their scheme almost from the first, beyond
a doubt.  Thinking that Norton would
embark on the boat as originally planned,
he had forged the letter from Ayres, together
with another to the Regulators.  Thus
Norton and the richly-laden craft together
would come into the hands of Grigg and the
gang.  Naturally, he could not have foreseen
what had happened at the last moment.
</p>

<p>
Carefully and slowly, Norton told the
other two what had taken place in Louisville,
of that terrible ride, and lastly of how
Duval must have tricked them all around.
When he had finished, Red Hugh was
plucking thoughtfully at his beard while
Brookfield was staring at him in alarmed
dismay.  For this, Norton did not quite
see the reason.
</p>

<p>
"It is not yet too late to repair matters,
even though our plans have gone awry,"
he stated, as new hope began to creep through
him.  He got to his feet, shakily.  After
all, there was no great hurry.  Thank heaven,
he had been able to meet Brookfield and so
warn him in time!
</p>

<p>
"How&mdash;repair matters?" frowned the captain.
</p>

<p>
"Why, 'tis simple enough"&mdash;and Norton
essayed a faint smile.  "We'll merely get
back against the current to Henderson and
take the Regulators aboard&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Think you I carry horses on my down
voyage?" asked Brookfield, the veins in
his stolid face standing out under his stress
of emotion as he spoke.  "Man, to get back
is impossible!  With only nine of us aboard
in all, we could never row this craft
upstream, and I have no horses to work the
machinery."
</p>

<p>
Norton nodded, grasping the point, and
looked out across the bulwark.  They were
now some seven miles below Diamond Island,
and another island was in sight ahead.
There seemed to be few settlements below.
</p>

<p>
"Well, then, we had best tie up at the
first settlement which we reach, Captain
Brookfield.  There we can either take some
extra men aboard to serve in place of the
Regulators, or else you can tie up and wait
till I can get back to Henderson for our
own men&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"That would take too long," broke in
Red Hugh, speaking almost for the first
time.  "True, we might take some extra men
aboard, but we know not whom we can trust
down here.  And Duval is ahead of us, eh?"
</p>

<p>
Norton nodded.  Duval had probably
crossed over to the Indiana shore, for they
had caught no sight of him.  At this juncture
the sadly bewildered Brookfieid left them,
to take charge of the island passage, and
the Louisianian despatched Red Hugh in
search of food and drink.
</p>

<p>
While he was making a hearty meal,
which put new strength and life into his
jaded body, Brookfield rejoined the two
of them, and all discussed the situation,
which began to assume rather alarming
proportions.
</p>

<p>
Norton's suggestion was the most
conservative.  By tying up at one of the
settlements they could take men aboard, and
might find trustworthy men who could be
initiated into the whole plot.  Red Hugh,
however, who had seemed to awaken
thoroughly to the affair, now made a
counter-proposal.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen, we are by no means cowards,
I believe," he said, his deep-set grey eyes
flaming a little as he spoke.  "We are not
so far from the Wabash at present.  How
about it, sir?"
</p>

<p>
Brookfield nodded gravely.
</p>

<p>
"Some twenty miles, for Slim Island is
just ahead.  Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, it seems to me that from what
Captain Norton says," went on Red Hugh
calmly, "all escape is cut off to Duval in
the rear.  He cannot well return to Louisville
but must go on to Louisiana if he is to get
away&mdash;and he must do so before this boat
or others get down the river to give warning
of him.  And since it is most like that his
gang has their camp somewhere near the
Wabash, the militia would speedily make
an end of him now that the secret of Blacknose
is known."
</p>

<p>
"True enough," assented Norton.  "Though
he might also escape by way of Vincennes
and Detroit to Canada.  But what next?"
</p>

<p>
"Why should we not continue as we first
planned?" said Red Hugh deliberately.  "We
will pass the Wabash by nightfall, so let
us continue without pausing to tie up
to-night, and if we run past Duval, so much
the better.  We can give warning of
him at the lower settlements; at Fort
Massac&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And from Fort Massac we can quarter
back with men to find him," broke in Norton
hastily.
</p>

<p>
"But what if he attacks us on the way?"
argued the worried Brookfield.  "He will
know that we bear news of him, after all
that has chanced behind us.  He will not
easily allow us to escape to bear this news
down-river and so cut off all his chances&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Let him attack!" said Red Hugh boldly.
"Not all of your crew are traitors, and
Mr. Norton and I can keep good watch!
Those dogs have only dared to destroy in
the dark; one shot, and they will turn
tail&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I doubt it," interrupted Norton drily.
"Duval is no coward."  He said no more
for a little, but looked over the water with
a frown.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Somewhere in that wilderness was Kitty
Grigg, and practically in the power of
Duval.  Up to a certain extent, he believed
Abel Grigg would protect her; but that
protection would not go far with such a
man as Duval.  At thought of how he had
failed in his task, of how he had been
outwitted and snared and duped, he groaned
inwardly.  A great weariness closed in upon
him, and he turned haggard eyes on the
two men beside him.
</p>

<p>
"Settle it as you will," he said slowly.
"I care not, gentlemen; I must have sleep.
Whatever decision you reach, I will agree
to it.  Now show me a place to sleep in
peace, Brookfield."
</p>

<p>
The anxious-eyed riverman nodded and
led him forward to a cabin, where Norton
turned in on a bunk and was asleep instantly.
</p>

<p>
While he rested, the other two discussed
the situation for an hour or more.  Brookfield
was in dread anxiety for his ship and cargo,
bitterly regretting that he had ever entered
upon the venture.  Red Hugh, in some
contempt, stuck firmly to it that his plan
was the best.
</p>

<p>
In the end, his insistence overbore the
hesitation of the other, who helplessly
consented to continue the voyage.  After all,
they were not far behind Duval, and there
was a good chance that they might slip
past down the river before the gang would
expect them.  Moreover, by not stopping
they would not be so liable to attack as they
would be if tied up over-night after the
usual river fashion.
</p>

<p>
Of the six men who composed the crew,
Brookfield could trust two of them, brothers,
to the death; of the other four he was by
no means so certain.  Once the decision had
been reached, Red Hugh instructed these
two men to sleep on deck that night with
their rifles ready at hand.
</p>

<p>
Toward sunset Norton was aroused, and
came on deck to find that they were just
approaching Wabash Island.  They passed
by the Indiana sound, and when darkness
fell the Wabash itself lay behind them and
Brookfield breathed more freely.
</p>

<p>
The Louisianian agreed to the proposed
plan.  Red Hugh took watch until midnight,
but as Norton no longer felt the
need of sleep after his day-long slumber,
he remained on deck with the hunter.
</p>

<p>
Brookfield himself slept little.  He was
exceedingly anxious for the safety of his
craft, and after an hour of sweeping along
through the pitch darkness, his over-wrought
nerves went to pieces.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen," he broke out nervously,
approaching Norton and Red Hugh as they
were smoking together in the bow, "I can
stand this no longer!  I beg of you, let us
set in to the bank and be done with this
strain!  We need fear no attack here; we
are just above Shawneetown, in a
well-settled district, and not even Blacknose
would take the chance of making an attack
on us here."
</p>

<p>
Red Hugh was furiously angry, but Norton
quieted him.  He saw that the responsibility
for ship and lading had quite unnerved
Brookfield, and felt sorry for the man.
Moreover, it looked very much as though
Duval would never dare an attack in this
well-settled district of the river.
</p>

<p>
That their plans were turned topsy-turvy
mattered nothing to him.  He was indifferent
as to what course was adopted, and said so.
</p>

<p>
"If it will please you to seek the bank,
then do it," he said quietly.  "It seems
there may be danger in whatever we do,
so do you act as you think best in the matter,
Captain Brookfield."
</p>

<p>
With obvious relief, the latter quickly
routed out his men and set them at the
sweeps, grumbling and cursing.  Red Hugh
went to his bunk in the cabin in huge disgust
with everyone in general; Norton, however,
remained on deck, determined to watch the
night out at least.
</p>

<p>
The boat was fetched close in to the
Indiana shore and after carefully sounding
the channel, Brookfield at last tied her up
to a huge jutting tree.  Norton ascertained that
they were three miles above Shawneetown,
which was a large settlement of nearly thirty
cabins, and that Brookfield's spirits had
now bounded high above any thought of
danger.
</p>

<p>
None the less, Norton stayed in the bow,
one of the two trusted men agreeing to
keep watch in the stern, for he would take
no chances.  The night was peaceful, warm,
and rippling; had it not been for Kitty
Grigg, the Louisianian would have been
more than content to pursue his journey to
the south and let Duval be dealt with later.
He had already resolved to leave the boat
at Fort Massac; with Red Hugh, he could
work back on a scout along the&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Whether the horse-boat had been watched
and followed, or whether her riding-light
had betrayed her position, Norton never
knew for certain.  He was just filling his
pipe afresh when all his dreams were shattered
abruptly.
</p>

<p>
From the shadows aft beneath the horse-gallery
there flitted a little sparkle of steel in
the moonlight, and a knife thudded into the
bulwark between his uplifted arm and his side.
</p>

<p>
Norton dropped his pipe with a crash,
and fell back motionless, his hand on his
rifle.  Every sense was on the alert instantly,
every fragment of woodcraft to the fore.
From the shore he heard nothing except
the soft ripple of waves, but there was a
low murmur aft, and the sound of wood
striking on wood, as though a boat had
ground into the stern.  The man on guard
there, Norton concluded swiftly, must have
been finished off by another knife.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly and softly, a man appeared
crawling forward in the shadow of the port
bulwark, watching his recumbent figure;
Norton recognized one of the crew.  Quietly
he shifted his rifle as he lay, hot rage swelling
within him.  A moment later the man's
body came in line with the sights, and
Norton pulled trigger.
</p>

<p>
The roar of the shot blew the night quiet
to shreds.  The riverman gave one convulsive
spring and dropped half across the bulwark,
where he lay motionless.  Norton leaped up
with a shout of alarm.
</p>

<p>
"Brookfield!  Hugh!  On deck!"
</p>

<p>
Then he dropped behind a huge tobacco
hogshead as another shot split the night
and the bullet sang past his ear.  From
somewhere aft there came a wild confusion
of voices, oaths, and the scuffle of feet.
Norton feverishly reloaded, taking the pistol
from his belt also.  Beyond all doubt,
Blacknose had struck.
</p>

<p>
The next moment, while he was still
ramming his bullet home, a swarm of dark
figures appeared rushing forward, along the
port side of the deck.  A shot and the roar
of Brookfield's stentorian voice sounded from
the stern.  Norton caught up his pistol and
discharging it into the mass of figures stopped
them momentarily; he was answered by
a scattering fire which swept above him
harmlessly.
</p>

<p>
Upon that, the whole craft leaped into
a mad swirl of fighting yelling men in
utter confusion.  Brookfield appeared on
the horse-galley up above the deck, his
pistols in hand, and he fired down twice
into the crowd.  A dozen shots replied, and
Norton saw him reel and go down.
</p>

<p>
With a rush, the assailants now came
at him in the bow.  By this time the
Louisianian had re-primed, and without
hesitation he flung up his long rifle and
fired at short range.
</p>

<p>
He had got two of the pirates in line,
and both went down with a yell; at the
same instant there swelled up a wild
war-whoop, and the tall figure of Red Hugh
appeared in the moonlight.  As his yell
shrilled high, he fired into the group of men;
instead of breaking before him, they closed on
him instantly.  Red Hugh's prediction was
proving terribly false, Norton thought swiftly.
</p>

<p>
Somewhere the cold terrible voice of Duval
was directing the attack.  Norton had no
more chance to reload.  Other dark figures
came running forward, and a moment later
Red Hugh on the fore-deck and Norton in
the bow were surrounded by a whirl of
fighting men.
</p>

<p>
For a little, Norton almost believed that
they would clear the ship unaided.  Both
were fighting with clubbed rifles, and the
long six-foot guns made terrific weapons
for such close work.  The pirates must have
emptied their own guns, for they fired no
more shots, and there was no chance to
reload; the battle had become hand to
hand, savage in its brutality.
</p>

<p>
Twice Norton swept his gun-butt down
full upon a man, and each time the pirate
went down like an axed ox with his skull
crushed; the Louisianian was now fighting
for his life, and realized it thoroughly.
A tomahawk struck him and fell to the
deck with a clang, thrown unskilfully;
Norton leaped forward and whirled his rifle
on the thrower with all his strength.
</p>

<p>
As he did so, his foot slipped and he
half-fell; the rifle came down on a hogshead
and shattered in his hands.  With one savage
yell of exultation, the enemy closed in upon
him.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Then, out of the turmoil of blows and
shouts and curses, rose the clear laugh of
Norton as his foes drew back.  He was
on one knee, pressed against the bulwark,
but he held knife and tomahawk in hand,
and somewhere ir the press before him he had
caught sight of Duval.  The man's face goaded
him, and while his foes drew back a pace,
Norton laughed again and leaped into the
midst of them, striking savagely.
</p>

<p>
His weapons flashed and bit in the
moonlight, and with a thrill he heard the
war-whoop of Red Hugh rising again.  His
assailants were all masked save for Duval,
whom he had not seen again; the next
instant, however, he caught sight of Grigg
coming at him.
</p>

<p>
There was no mistaking the man's size
and figure, despite his mask and the black
paint which covered his face and clotted
his beard.  From one side a clubbed rifle
swung down on Norton; he warded it off, and
seeing that the man was one of the treacherous
crew-members, flung out his tomahawk.
The keen edge bit into the man's brain
and he went down.  Then Grigg was
leaping out.
</p>

<p>
Whirling, Norton ducked the knife-thrust.
There was no chance to use his own weapon,
and as he swung around he brought up his
fist, closed on the knife-haft, and drove
it straight into Grigg's beard.  All Norton's
weight was behind the blow, and the big man
went down with a single groan, caught full on
the point of the chin and knocked senseless.
</p>

<p>
In the same moment, Norton realized that
all was lost.  A wild yell of triumph had
quavered up, and now a solid mass of men
came charging down on him.  Red Hugh
had been overcome at last.  Then, as Norton
drew back and faced the snarling ring of
savage masks and weapons, the uproar
quieted with unexpected suddenness to the
cold voice of Duval.
</p>

<p>
"Quiet, boys!"
</p>

<p>
He stepped forth, unarmed, dominant,
terrible.  Norton, his chest heaving and
with a wild riot of sheer hatred surging
high in his brain, watched the man as there
fell deep silence&mdash;a silence broken only
by the groaning of wounded men and the
peaceful ripple of water.
</p>

<p>
"Surrender, Mr. Norton," said Duval
calmly.  "You&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Dog!" snarled Norton, mad with rage
and with the pain of his wounds and bruises.
"Yellow dog!"
</p>

<p>
And dropping his knife, he sprang out
upon Duval, for there was no thought of
surrender in his mind.  A single yell of
warning from the circle of men; then the two
were fighting like madmen with their bare
fists.
</p>

<p>
Try as he would, Norton found his blows
blocked, while Duval's fists hammered home
upon him terrifically.  Slowly his rage
cooled of its flaming fury, and with new
caution he realized that this was no common
adversary.  He staggered into a clinch,
desperate.
</p>

<p>
A moment more, and Norton felt savage
joy as he began to drive his fists into Duval's
face and felt himself slowly mastering the
other.  Back went Duval&mdash;and back again,
with Norton sending in relentless blows,
while the lawyer fought back in grim silence.
</p>

<p>
Then a sudden low growl swept the watching
circle as Duval reeled and clutched
out at the air.  Too late, Norton saw a
rifle thrust between his legs.  He tripped,
and as he did so three men flung themselves
on him bodily.
</p>

<p>
At last he went to the deck&mdash;pummelled,
covered with slight knife-wounds, but still
fighting savagely.  Little by little they
pinned him down, drew hands and feet
together, bound him fast.
</p>

<p>
Brookfield's horse-boat was captured.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
</h3>

<p>
Norton was badly battered.  More than
one knife had nicked his flesh, and Duval's
fists had given him a badly cut lip and a
bruised and bleeding face, but he was hurt
in no vital place.  Now, as he lay bound,
for the first time he began to take coherent
stock of the river-pirates.
</p>

<p>
Three of the boat-crew had been of the
gang; the others, with Brookfield, were
dead.  Two of the traitors had also fallen
and with them five more of the gang; three
others lay sorely wounded.  Besides these,
eight sound men remained, with Grigg and
Duval.  Red Hugh had been stunned, and
for some reason both he and Norton were not
knifed as they lay.  Instead, they were
lifted and carried down into one of the
four large skiffs at the stern of the
horse-boat.
</p>

<p>
With them were placed the three wounded
men, and then the others fell to work under
orders from Grigg, now recovered from
Norton's blow.
</p>

<p>
The four skiffs were drawn up alongside,
and the best of the cargo was rapidly
transferred from the larger boat.  Helpless,
Norton watched operations; now that the
work had been carried through, the men
had removed their masks.
</p>

<p>
All appeared to be either woodsmen or
settlers, men of the roughest and most
brutal type on the border.  From their
snatches of talk he gathered that they had
made a common settlement on the upper
reaches of the Saline River.  This was in a
purely Indian country, where the last
remnants of the once powerful Ohio tribes
had gathered under protection of the still
more powerful Shawnees.
</p>

<p>
"We'll git them thar Miamis on the
rampage," observed one of the pirates at
work above him, with a coarse laugh.
"Ought to have one more high ol' time
afore we split up, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Got to use up that licker," growled
another in assent.  "What's the chief goin'
to do with them two fellers?"
</p>

<p>
The answer, fortunately, was lost on
Norton.  It was just as well for his own
peace of mind that he gained no inkling
of Duval's plan till later.
</p>

<p>
With the best of Brookfield's rich cargo
stowed away in the four skiffs, the eight
sound men piled down into one of them;
by grim irony that cargo which was to have
served for a lure had now been taken by
the intended victim, and Norton writhed
in his bonds at the thought.  The boat in
which he lay, with Red Hugh and the
wounded, was taken in tow with the other
two; Grigg descended among the men and
took charge, and last of all came Duval.
Even before he came, Norton saw why he
had lingered, and what was intended.
</p>

<p>
As the four skiffs pulled out and drew
away in a slow line, the horse-boat slowly
drifted out into the stream, her lines severed.
The moon had by this time gone down,
but looking back, Norton saw a burst of
flames from the boat.  She drifted away
with her load of dead, the fire rising high
into a pyramid of flame and smoke above her
ungainly shape.
</p>

<p>
Then they were passing out of the river
by a narrow channel, and to his surprise
the Louisianian found that this led into
a good-sized lake, some ten miles across.
The eight men who occupied the forward
boat rowed steadily through the darkness,
Grigg giving them low directions; there
was a faint glare on the horizon, denoting
the burning craft they had abandoned.
After an hour or more of this progress,
they drew in to a low shore ahead.
</p>

<p>
Norton was lifted and flung on shore, and
as Red Hugh was sent after him, he saw
that the latter had recovered consciousness.
Then, while the cargoes were being transferred
to wagons, Grigg and Duval engaged
in a swift discussion as to the disposal of
the wounded men.
</p>

<p>
"I won't have them around the camp at
this juncture," came the cold tones of the
lawyer.  "When this business has been
finished we'll have to separate and had
best start here.  Send two men with the
wounded over to Kentucky in one boat,
and sink the other three here as usual."
</p>

<p>
So two of the raiders rowed off with the
three wounded men, these being unable to
ride.  The other boats were sunk under
the shore-trees, and with their trail covered
behind them, the raiders started.  Norton
and Red Hugh were lifted to a wagon,
just as the grey dawn was breaking.
</p>

<p>
The Louisianian was too firmly bound
to dream of getting free, and attempted no
converse with his companion.  Having fallen
between two huge sacks of flax, he could
see nothing and at last dropped into a
troubled sleep, broken at short intervals
by the jolting of the wagon.
</p>

<p>
Toward noon the first and only halt of
the journey took place; and here occurred
an incident which to Norton seemed slight
enough at the time, but which was destined
to have tremendous consequences later.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The stop had been made near a rude
cabin built beside a spring, and when
Norton had been lifted out of the wagon,
he saw that it was an Indian clearing.
The redskin farmer and his squaw were
being forced into cooking for the party,
whom they seemed both to hate and fear,
probably with good cause.
</p>

<p>
Red Hugh lay beside Norton on the
ground, watching grimly, in silence.  Indeed,
the old man had said no word that morning,
and in his silent watching and his motionless
endurance Norton read a tacit menace of
strength restrained.  Duval sent the Indian
squaw to feed the prisoners some cornpone,
refusing to loosen their bonds, while
one of the men stood guard.
</p>

<p>
As the woman bent over them, Norton
heard Red Hugh murmur something in the
Indian tongue.  The guard stopped him
harshly, but the wrinkled squaw looked at
Norton, then started at sight of his moccasins.
</p>

<p>
"Git to work," growled the guard, striking
her roughly over the head.  "You got a
man o' your own, so don't make eyes at
them fellers!"
</p>

<p>
This kindly pleasantry drew a roar of
applause from the others, and after giving
the prisoners a gourd of water each, the
squaw retired, still watching Norton.  A
half-hour later the party had again taken
up its way.  Now, however, Red Hugh
lay beside Norton on the wagon.
</p>

<p>
"I told that squaw to look at your
moccasins," he whispered softly to the latter.
"She looked to me like a Shawnee, though
her husband was a Delaware.  If she takes
the hint and Tecumthe hears of this affair,
I feel sorry for these devils when the Shawnees
avenge you."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense," returned Norton, laughing
harshly.  "You're away off the track, Hugh.
Tecumthe will never bother his head over
me, even if he hears of it.  Our only hope is
that Audubon or Ayres will get after us in
alarm with the Regulators, and will trace us."
</p>

<p>
"They won't trace this gang," returned
the other.  "Two of 'em are wiping out
the tracks after us."
</p>

<p>
Neither of them said more, Norton
relapsing into a troubled doze.  Just as
evening was drawing on, they came to the
journey's end.  And at last Norton found
himself in the headquarters of the gang.
</p>

<p>
It was a settlement rather than a cache,
consisting of a little cluster of buildings.
Two of these were large sleeping cabins
for the men, where a few slatternly women
appeared at the doors with loud ribaldry.
Another was a large kitchen and dining-room,
with a lean-to where dwelt Grigg
and his daughter.  Norton felt his heart
ache for the helpless girl.
</p>

<p>
Behind all, at the edge of a small stream
which passed beyond the settlement, was a
long low building where the stolen goods
were stored, as it appeared.  Besides these,
there were two outlying shacks where some
of the men lived with Indian wives or
worse; farther downstream was a corn-patch,
with signs of cleared ground beyond,
along the banks of the stream.
</p>

<p>
The whole place was doubtless a year or
two old, and bespoke thorough organization.
Duval, who now seemed quite at
home and absolutely in authority, was
beyond doubt the organizer, for he seemed
to rule the place with an iron hand.  Norton
and Red Hugh were carried into the big
store-barn and left, unguarded but bound.
The men at once fell to work fetching in
the goods brought by cart, adding them to
the quantities already laid up in the cache.
</p>

<p>
Norton was wondering what had become
of Kitty Grigg, when, through the open
doorway of the barn-like building, where
barrels and casks and sacks were piled
high around the walls and floor, came a
dim shape against the dusk outside.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Norton!" sounded the girl's voice,
softly.
</p>

<p>
"Over here, Kitty," returned Norton cheerfully,
and a moment later she was kneeling
beside him, sobbing.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, what has happened?" she asked,
grief-smitten.  "Duval is in Abel's room,
and they're talking about me!  I'm
afraid&mdash;I don't know what they're planning to do,
and it seems&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Have you been harmed, girl?" asked
Red Hugh, and his voice was grim.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;but&mdash;Duval has sent for a circuit-rider
from Vincennes, and means to marry
me&mdash;soon&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Norton perceived that all barriers were
down between them, and that she no longer
doubted concerning the identity of Abel
Grigg with Blacknose.  Quietly and without
holding anything back, he told her of the
attack on the boat, and all which had preceded it.
</p>

<p>
This was no time for tears, and under
the influence of his steady grave voice
the girl calmed herself.  Norton had taken her
hand between his own bound ones, and gradually
left her regaining steadiness and poise.
</p>

<p>
"Can you get a knife and free us
to-night?" he asked suddenly.  "We could
take horses and get away&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No," she returned hopelessly.  "It would
be no use.  Abel"&mdash;and Norton noted that
she no longer spoke of him as father&mdash;"Abel
keeps men on guard always, and he
is usually on watch himself.  We have two
rooms in that lean-to behind the kitchen, and
I cannot get out without his knowing&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Came the sound of steps and the glitter
of light from the doorway behind her.
With a low gasp of fright, the girl rose
and fled to the far end of the place, where
she crouched behind some piled kegs.  Norton
twisted about to see Grigg, Duval, and two
men enter with lanterns.
</p>

<p>
Setting down their lights, the four grouped
themselves comfortably on kegs around the
two prisoners.  Norton noted without grief
that his fists had left the face of Duval
badly marked, while the lawyer stared down
at his captive in savage hatred.  Red Hugh
was completely disregarded, but Norton was
soon to find that the old man had been
taken alive for very definite reasons.
</p>

<p>
"Your race is done, Captain Norton,"
said Duval coldly.  "I presume that you
are now quite satisfied of your folly?  I
hope to have a very pretty scene for you
to-morrow night, when Madam Grigg and
I will be united in holy matrimony&mdash;save
the mark!"
</p>

<p>
The others joined in the laughter, as
Duval kicked Norton roughly.  The
Louisianian did not reply.
</p>

<p>
"Well, let's hear about it, Cap," spoke
up one of the evil-eyed men impatiently
enough.  "The boys want to split the stuff
and be off, so if we're a-goin' to have any
fun first&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You'll have your fun," broke in Duval
easily.  "Look at Mr. Norton's powder-horn
and see if you recognize it."
</p>

<p>
The two leaned over Norton, pulling the
red-streaked horn into view.  A curse broke from
them, and one of them kicked Norton again.
</p>

<p>
"Tobin's!" burst out the man vengefully.
"Did the cuss git Tobin, Cap?  That's why
he ain't showed up?"
</p>

<p>
"Exactly"&mdash;and Duval smiled cruelly.
"Tell the other boys about it.  Now to-morrow
the circuit-rider we sent Darby after last
week will be in from the north.  To-morrow
night Miss Kitty and I will be married.
One of you go over to the Miami village
and bring 'em all over for a jamboree,
squaws and all."
</p>

<p>
"We'll git the squaws all right," jeered
one of the men.
</p>

<p>
"The next morning," continued Duval,
"we'll divide the stuff and separate.  Grigg,
here, will take you and the bulk of the
cache up to Vincennes, where you can sell
it and scatter&mdash;and do it fast!"
</p>

<p>
"How 'bout you?" queried one of the
men.  Duval leered knowingly.
</p>

<p>
"My wife and I go to Detroit, and from
there over the border.  This country is too hot to
hold me, boys, but you aren't known yet."
</p>

<p>
"Well, what about these two fellers?"
demanded Grigg heavily, with a black look
down at Norton.  "Why not shoot 'em
and have done?  I don't aim to leave no
spies to tell on me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"We'll have better fun than that"&mdash;and
Duval held up a lantern.  "This fellow
with the beard is Red Hugh, the Indian
killer.  Understand?  After we've had our
fun out of the Miamis, we'll give them
back some of their weapons and turn 'em
loose on these two.  There'll be a show
worth seeing, eh?"
</p>

<p>
A cold thrill ran over Norton, while the
others broke into wild applause of Duval's
ingenuity.  The Louisianian knew well what
was intended.  Like other settlers along
the border, this gang of Duval's was
accustomed to a certain form of "sport" at the
expense of their redskin neighbours.
</p>

<p>
This took the form of gathering the
Indians, taking away their weapons, and
then plying them with whisky.  At the
proper moment they would be set to fighting,
and the resultant encounter would often
last for hours, without great danger to the
combatants, but with intense amusement to
the watchers.
</p>

<p>
Now, however, Duval had injected another
element into it.  The name of Red Hugh
seemed well known, and even Norton could
guess what would happen when the drunken
Miamis would be given their weapons and
let loose upon their deadly enemy.  It was
a sure, amusing, and ingenious scheme to
get rid of the two prisoners.
</p>

<p>
The two men went out, laughing, and
Duval turned on Grigg.
</p>

<p>
"I have the papers made out for your
signature, and we'll throw the fear of hell
into that circuit-rider.  You're sure Darby
will get the right one&mdash;the loose-jawed,
weak-mouthed one?  If he got that blasted
Quaker Dennis, we'd have a stiff time
persuading him all was right.  The girl
will kick."
</p>

<p>
"Darby's wise enough to get the right
feller," rejoined Grigg.  "Whar's that five
hundred ye promised me?"
</p>

<p>
"Here&mdash;come on outside."  Duval rose,
with a clink of coins.  The two left the
place, taking their lanterns with them.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
As the girl came stealing back to his
side, Norton felt like rebuking her for the
feeling which had caused her to accompany
Abel Grigg into the woods; then shame
struck him, and pity and love.  For a
moment he held her hand in silence;
then she had pulled free and was gone,
sobbing.
</p>

<p>
"Curse those devils!" muttered Red Hugh
thickly.
</p>

<p>
Norton echoed the words, and after that
there was silence.
</p>

<p>
Slowly the night dragged away between
dozing and the pain of their bonds.  Shortly
after daylight one of the slatternly women
came with food and water and fed them
amid a stream of ribaldry and curses.
Norton was glad when at length she departed
and left them alone.
</p>

<p>
A guard was stationed at the door, but
no speech passed between the two captives.
Red Hugh stared up unblinking at the
beams above, a wild ferocity gathered in
his blood-stained face.  Toward noon there
was shouting and the thud of hoofs from
outside, and Duval entered hastily with
Abel Grigg.  Norton rightly conjectured
that the circuit-rider had arrived.
</p>

<p>
"Give him that far cabin," ordered the
lawyer hurriedly and in a low voice.  "Keep
him quiet in there and don't let him suspect
anything yet.  I'll visit him later.  He's
a coward, from his face, and I'll fix him up
right."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
At last that long day came to an end;
as sunset darkened the barn-like structure,
the camp awoke into activity.  Hogsheads
and casks and sacks were piled to the roof
at the far end, where half a dozen whisky
kegs were also set out, ready to be broached
later.
</p>

<p>
Around the walls were hung lanterns,
while the centre of the floor was cleared
for the fun.  Norton and Red Hugh, still
fast bound, were placed on a pile of sacks
near the door, in partial obscurity.
</p>

<p>
From the scattered talk of the men Norton
gathered that they intended carrying off
some of the prettiest of the Miami squaws
after the debauch; also, all seemed well with
their projects and they were in high fettle,
for the Miamis had arrived.
</p>

<p>
An hour later the lanterns were lighted and
the gang assembled.  Grigg brought in the
angry and frightened Kitty, forcing her to
a place not far from the two prisoners, he
himself standing beside her.  At sight of her
white features, Norton tugged desperately
but vainly at his bonds, raging.
</p>

<p>
In all there were fourteen of the gang, and
five women&mdash;most of them already half-drunk
and all of them brutish in the extreme.
The circuit-rider did not put in an appearance.
</p>

<p>
Now the Miamis were brought in, men at
the door relieving them of their guns as they
came, and Grigg shaking hands with the
warriors in turn.  Of these there were a
score.  Norton was rather surprised to find
that the squaws, all enveloped in blankets
from head to heel, numbered nearly twice
as many as the braves.  One or two of the
gang attempted familiarities, but these Duval
rebuked with an iron fist.
</p>

<p>
They were squalid red men enough, were
these Miami warriors; liquor-sodden,
shuffling, and debased in the extreme.  One
alone seemed of superior quality.  He was
a tall figure, blanket-swathed to the waist,
who, after his handshake with Grigg, cast a
swift glance around and then stood immobile
not far from Norton's recumbent figure.
Kitty watched in evident ignorance of what
was going on; she was soon undeceived.
</p>

<p>
"Broach the kegs, boys!" shouted Duval
suddenly, when the last of the Miamis had
entered.
</p>

<p>
With a yell of delight the men sprang
forward.  In five minutes the six kegs were
surrounded by a grunting, struggling mass
of Miamis, the squaws standing to one side
and eating strips of dried venison which the
raiders handed out freely.
</p>

<p>
Norton and Red Hugh lay side by side on
the sacks.  Grigg stood with Kitty, a few
feet distant, and between them was the
tall Indian, his blanket drawn over his head.
Grigg urged him to drink, but he refused with
a guttural negation, meeting with no more
importunity.  Indeed, the whites were
drinking with as much abandon as the warriors,
save for Duval and Grigg alone.
</p>

<p>
A few moments later the warriors were
shoved back from the kegs and their knives
and tomahawks removed to the pile of rifles
beside the door.  Then one of the gang stepped
in and by dint of some rough horse-play,
highly amusing to his comrades, provoked two
of the red men into a rough and tumble fight.
</p>

<p>
Within five minutes the whole group of
warriors was engaged in a frenzied scuffle,
amid roars of laughter from the watchers.
In their drunken awkwardness they did little
damage, and every eye watched save that
of Kitty; she had covered her face with her
hands and stood trembling.
</p>

<p>
"Give 'em more licker!" roared Grigg
suddenly, and rushed across the floor.
</p>

<p>
No sooner had he moved than the tall
Indian took one swift step toward Norton.
A knife flamed in his hand, and the startled
Louisianian contracted shrinkingly.
</p>

<p>
Then the knife had severed the cords at
his ankles, and he looked into the face of
Tecumthe.
</p>

<p>
"Be quiet!" warned the chief in English.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap15"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
</h3>

<p>
Norton lay in paralysed amazement while
his wrists were freed, and Tecumthe turned
to Red Hugh.  The Indian, wasting no time
on questions, seemed quite conversant with
the whole situation.
</p>

<p>
"Be ready," he whispered rapidly.  "Take
the young woman from the door when I
strike!"
</p>

<p>
Red Hugh grunted, and Tecumthe once
more assumed his negligent attitude as Grigg
returned across the floor.
</p>

<p>
Norton's wild surge of astonished delight
soon passed.  The thick moccasins had protected
his ankles to some extent, but his hands
were for the moment useless, all circulation
stopped by the tight thongs.
</p>

<p>
After all, Tecumthe could do little against
this murderous gang by himself.  How, then,
did he intend to "strike"?  Did he have a
band of his warriors outside?
</p>

<p>
"It wasn't such a wild shot about those
moccasins after all," came Red Hugh's
chuckling whisper.  "Looks like he's going
to give us a chance to slip away.  Work
your arms a bit."
</p>

<p>
The Louisianian nodded, and very slowly
perceived life creeping back into his numbed
hands.  Grigg and the rest were roaring at
the antics of the drunken, fighting Miamis;
Duval, perched on a big hogshead at the far
end of the room, was inciting them to further
efforts.
</p>

<p>
Locked in pairs, the warriors were striking,
kicking, rolling over the floor in a
bestial encounter which left Norton shocked
to the core; he had heard of these affairs
often but had never seen one before.
</p>

<p>
Duval's men were plying them with liquor
amid wild shouts of encouragement, and
were fast growing drunk themselves; so far,
however, they were too much interested in
their amusements to bother the squaws, who
stood lined up against the farther wall and
grouped around the door.
</p>

<p>
Again Grigg's interest got the better of
his prudence, and with a bellow he leaped
out to join in the horse-play.  Kitty, left
alone, shrank past the tall figure of Tecumthe
toward Norton, who put out his hand and
gripped her arm.
</p>

<p>
"Quiet!" he said softly, as she turned
with a startled exclamation.  "Be ready
to make for the door, Kitty."
</p>

<p>
Wide-eyed, she stared into his face for a
moment, and under cover of her body
Norton half rose to take the pistols which
Tecumthe passed him.  He put one into the
hand of Red Hugh then waited.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
There was not long to wait.  With a
sudden movement, Tecumthe flung the blanket
from his splendid figure and stood forth in
all the glory of his half-naked bronze,
unpainted.  His voice rang out like a
clarion:
</p>

<p>
"Peace, dogs!"
</p>

<p>
Some of the Miamis ceased their scuffling;
others continued: one startled oath passed
around the line of white men as they saw him
step forward.  He made no pause, but raised
a clenched fist.
</p>

<p>
"Dogs of white men!"  And his clear
voice seemed to hold even Duval transfixed.
"Outcasts from your own race!  Murderers!
Why do you thus debase my red brethren,
the Miamis?  I know you&mdash;who you are and
what you do in the Shawnee country.  I know
your crimes.  I am going to show my white
brethren that Tecumthe can punish murderers
better than they!"
</p>

<p>
As the dread word <i>Tecumthe</i> passed through
the hall, Duval leaped to his feet with a
yell of warning.  It was too late.  The line
of squaws flung off their blankets and stepped
forth as warriors in all the glory of Shawnee
war-paint, rifles in hand.  From outside
came one shrill war-whoop&mdash;and the interior
of the building became an inferno as the
first rifles roared out.
</p>

<p>
Awful as the thing was, Norton had no
pity for Duval's gang.  He leaped up, seized
Kitty, and with Red Hugh at his side made
for the doorway.  Here a Shawnee halted
them with levelled rifle, but after a look
at Norton waved them on outside.
</p>

<p>
Kitty had fainted, mercifully.
</p>

<p>
The whole clearing seemed covered with
yelling, whooping demons.  As the three
emerged, Norton saw that the kitchens had
been fired, the flames lighting up the whole
scene.  An instant later, while Red Hugh
was taking the feet of the senseless girl,
Tecumthe himself joined them and led them
across the clearing to one of the farther
cabins.
</p>

<p>
Here, under guard of a stalwart warrior,
who went leaping off at sight of his chief, they
found a trembling, terror-smitten circuit-rider
who was too frightened to do more than
grovel before the chief.  Tecumthe kicked
him away, and Norton lowered Kitty's
body to the pallet in the corner.
</p>

<p>
Despite all he knew about this gang,
despite their intentions, he felt himself
somewhat a traitor to his own race.  Red
Hugh must have felt much the same thing,
for he was standing glaring at the chief, his
eyes terrible.
</p>

<p>
"It is not vengeance," said Tecumthe
composedly, watching the low building with
gloomy eye.  "It is justice.  A squaw met
my men; they told me of one who wore my
moccasins, in bonds.  I knew of these white
men, and I came in haste.  That is all."
</p>

<p>
"It's not all," cried Norton with sudden
remembrance.  "There are women in that
place&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Right!" broke out Red Hugh.  "Tecumthe,
we must have them, no matter what
manner of women they are!"
</p>

<p>
"Go," said the chief, nodding.  "My
men have seen your faces and you are
safe."
</p>

<p>
Norton sprang out on the word, and the
two men ran side by side to the building.
At the doorway, the scene within was
horrible; the place was filled with
powder-smoke, one corner was afire from a burst
lantern, and from the door were pouring
drunken Miamis, some of them still fighting
together.
</p>

<p>
And through the fire and smoke white men
and red were battling like madmen, with
axe and knife and pistol and clubbed rifle.
Norton well knew the danger he was in from
both sides, but shoving through the crowded
mass of Miamis he dashed within, Red Hugh
at his heels.
</p>

<p>
In one corner were crouching the five
terrified women, and as the Louisianian fought
his way through the struggling, yelling
groups, he saw a tall Shawnee tomahawk one
of the drabbled figures.
</p>

<p>
With a yell of fury, he raised his pistol
and fired; the warrior sprang high in his death
agony, and before he fell Norton was stripping
him of knife and tomahawk.  Then he
turned, and with Red Hugh tried to get the
four remaining women to the door.
</p>

<p>
They were terror-stricken, hysterical
creatures, mad with fear and liquor and
obscenity, but they were women.  As Norton
fought his way across the floor, he caught
glimpses through the smoke of the combat
which raged around him&mdash;glimpses which
remained etched on his memory for ever.
</p>

<p>
Grigg, with a huge axe, was standing back
to back with Duval, fighting a way across
the place amid a surging wave of the
redmen.  A drunken, trampled Miami was
striking right and left with a knife; screams
and oaths and prayers rose high as the
Shawnee steel bit deep, while over all shrilled
the dread war-whoop, keen and terrible.
</p>

<p>
"God!" breathed Norton.  "It's not a
fight, but a massacre!"
</p>

<p>
How they did it he never knew, but between
them, he and Red Hugh managed to get the
shrieking women to the door and outside.
The scene at the door was wild; pirates and
Shawnees and drunken Miamis were all
mingled in a horrible-struggling mass,
trampling dead and wounded indiscriminately.
And behind them all, the fire had seized
on the whisky kegs and was climbing high
through the whole building.
</p>

<p>
Norton breathed a prayer of thanks that
Kitty Grigg knew nothing of what was going
on; by dint of ceaseless efforts he got the
four women to the shack, at the door of
which still stood Tecumthe.  Driving them
inside, where Kitty lay motionless on the
pallet, he jerked the weak-mouthed
circuit-rider to his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Look after them, you," he snarled, and
rejoined the chief and Red Hugh outside.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Forth from the long barn, whose farther
end was now all aflame, was pouring a rout of
men, white and red intermixed, battling to
the death.  One of the rivermen started
across the clearing, but a dozen bullets from
the watching warriors caught him; the place
seemed to vomit death and destruction.
With a dark look Tecumthe, who had himself
struck no blow, turned to Red Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"Bear witness, Captain Moore," he said
sternly, "that we take neither scalps nor
plunder!  We make no war upon white men,
but upon murderers&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Moore?" cried Norton suddenly.  He
caught Red Hugh by the arm and swung him
around.  "Is that your name&mdash;Hugh Moore?
You're not the Captain Moore who left
Cincinnati with my father&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"God in heaven!" broke out Red Hugh
hoarsely, gripping him and staring into his
eyes.  "Are you Charles Norton's son&mdash;<i>look
out</i>!"
</p>

<p>
With a sudden movement, Norton was
flung a dozen feet away.
</p>

<p>
Whether they had broken through the
cordon of Indians or had escaped from some
rear entrance of the burning building, Norton
never found out; but Grigg and Duval, axe
and tomahawk in hand, were leaping across the
clearing, a string of Shawnees behind them.
</p>

<p>
Red Hugh's action was all that saved
Norton from Duval's tomahawk, which sang
over his head and thudded into the building
behind him.  Duval himself followed it
instantly, and gripped Norton as he was
rising; while Grigg swung his axe at Norton
from the side, to be grappled and flung back
by Red Hugh.
</p>

<p>
Norton saw Tecumthe motion his warriors
back, and then saw no more, for he was
fighting with a madman.  Duval seemed
crazed, as he might well be; Norton had
whipped out his knife, but had no chance to
use the weapon, for the other had gripped
his wrists and was throwing all his iron
strength into the desperate struggle.
</p>

<p>
All four of the fighting men crashed
together and went down in a confused mass.
The shock broke Duval's hold, and as they
came up Norton drove with his knife.  He
felt the steel bite, but still Duval fought on,
flinging himself forward bodily and bearing
Norton down again.
</p>

<p>
Meantime, Grigg and Red Hugh were
engaged in a mighty struggle, strength
against strength, giant against giant.
Reeling over the turf, the four men again came
together in mad collision; as they did so,
Norton sent his knife home for the second
time, and now Duval fell away from him.
</p>

<p>
Barely had he done so when Red Hugh's
pistol crashed out.  Grigg had taken
warning, and ducked, flinging his arms about
Moore's waist.  Directly behind him was
Norton, and as the shot flamed out, the
Louisianian flung his arms wide and toppled
over the body of Duval.
</p>

<p>
Then, for the first time, Tecumthe leaped
forward.  Frenzied by what he had done,
Red Hugh had beaten Grigg back with the
pistol-butt, and Grigg flashed out his
tomahawk to throw.  Before his arm came up,
Tecumthe had sprung between them like
a thing of steel; his own knife flamed in the
lurid glare, and Grigg collapsed.
</p>

<p>
Red Hugh stood for a moment, pistol in
hand.  There was a look of awful grief on his
face, and without a word he knelt over Norton.
</p>

<p>
For a moment he felt the heart of the
Louisianian, fumbled under the latter's
shirt, and then held up a small gold eagle.
</p>

<p>
"Good God," he muttered slowly, as
he held the eagle up to the lurid light of the
burning buildings.  "What's this?  What&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
For he had turned over the pin, and had
read the letters graven on its under side.
Slowly he tottered up, then looked at the
uncomprehending Tecumthe, a terrible horror
in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Hugh Edward Moore&mdash;my own pin&mdash;I've
killed him&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
And then, with a terrible cry, he fell upon
Norton's body.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI
</h3>

<p>
Norton awoke, with the strange and
persistent idea that the face of Audubon was
bending over him.  It was nonsense, of
course; he turned his head, and saw that he
lay quite alone, opposite a doorway.  The
sun was warm and bright outside.
</p>

<p>
What of that horrible nightmare, that hell
of death and madmen, of which he had
dreamed?  The very remembrance brought
out the cold sweat on his brow; he lifted his
hand and found his head bandaged.
</p>

<p>
Yet, looking out that doorway, he slowly
recalled what had happened on that night of
horror, for he was gazing across the clearing
where it had taken place.  There was no
doubt of it; a hundred yards away were the
ruins of the burned building, the cache-barn;
he himself, then, must be lying in
that shack to which he had brought the women?
</p>

<p>
The place seemed deserted, however.  There
were no Indians in sight; no bodies strewed the
clearing; everyone seemed to have vanished
and left him alone in desolation.  No&mdash;he
was mistaken after all; a voice strangely
like that of Audubon lifted faintly to him.
</p>

<p>
"&mdash;so do you see how he is, sir.  I must
look to the litter."
</p>

<p>
"Good heavens, am I mad?" thought
Norton.  He strained to sit up, but found
himself too weak.  An instant later a tall,
stooping figure darkened the doorway and
came to his side with a cry of joy.
</p>

<p>
For a moment Norton shrank away, not
recognizing the man who had come to his
knees beside the pallet.  Yet&mdash;it must be!
The shaggy hair was trimmed, the shaggy
matted beard was gone; but from the heavily
lined face, the deep-set eyes of Red Hugh
were looking at him.
</p>

<p>
"Man&mdash;man&mdash;we thought you never would
come round!"  And Red Hugh clasped his
hand in a warm pressure.
</p>

<p>
"By gad, what has happened to you?"  Norton
essayed a feeble smile of wonder.
Then like a stab memory came back to him;
this was no other than Captain Hugh Moore,
the same who had been his own father's
friend and brother-officer!
</p>

<p>
"Quiet!" commanded Moore sharply, as
Norton struggled to sit up in his high
excitement.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me quickly&mdash;are you the same
Moore&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, lad, the same."  Moore forced him
back on the pallet, yet with tender hands.
"Oh, lad, had I but known before!  Why
on earth did you not tell me your story, tell
me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"How should I know who you were?"
</p>

<p>
"True"&mdash;and the other nodded, his stern
face very sad.  "You said you came from
New Orleans, too; I never dreamed of the
truth until I had heard the tale from Kitty
and Mr. Audubon&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"For God's sake, tell me what has
happened!" broke out Norton, unable to
stand the suspense longer.  "Is Audubon
here?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Audubon came two days ago, bringing
the Regulators&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"How long have I been here?"
</p>

<p>
"It is three days since&mdash;since I shot you
with my own hand," returned the other
bitterly.  "Oh lad, when I owe everything in
the world to you, to think that I myself&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Tush, you owe me nothing," interrupted
Norton, bewildered.  "Then the Regulators
followed us after all?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Audubon met them at Henderson,
read the forged note, and followed us in
another boat.  He was too late.  They found
Brookfield's craft burned to the edge and
at length picked up the trail and came on.
Tecumthe and his warriors had already
departed&mdash;but let me show you something."
</p>

<p>
While Moore was still fumbling in his
pocket, Audubon stepped into the shack.
He gripped Norton's hand, and the two
friends looked at each other for a moment,
until Norton got out a low word.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, my friend!  I hoped you would
come&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"We did nothing," smiled Audubon
gravely.  "The work was done, and we
could but bury the dead and care for the living.
If he is able to be moved, Captain Moore,
we had best start soon that we may reach
the river by evening.  The litter is ready."
</p>

<p>
Moore bent his head in a gesture of assent.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, bring the litter here to the door
and we will start.  Waken Kitty."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," added Norton eagerly.  "Is she well?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite," laughed Audubon, and stepped
from the door.  "She has been nursing you."
</p>

<p>
With his departure, Moore stooped and
placed something in Norton's hand.  The
Louisianian gazed at it with a thrill of
remembrance.  It was the golden eagle belonging to
Kitty.
</p>

<p>
"Eh?"  He looked up sharply.  "Where
got you this&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"From your shirt, lad.  Why, Norton&mdash;don't
you see?"
</p>

<p>
"See?" repeated Norton, amazed.  "What
mean you?"
</p>

<p>
With a great laugh Red Hugh plunged to
his knees and caught Norton's hand; the
man seemed transformed with some mad
joy too great for words.  Half in fear, Norton
drew back, and at this Moore only laughed
out again.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, blind, blind!" he cried ringingly.
"And you knew that Kitty had been found
among Indians, that this pin was hers&mdash;yet
you never suspected it!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap17"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII
</h3>

<p>
Two riders were walking their horses
along the Beargrass Creek Road, on the way
to Colonel Taylor's farm.  They drew rein
at a bend, just beyond which was a fringe
of trees and a dried mudhole.
</p>

<p>
"I brought you to this road for a purpose,
Kitty," said Norton gravely.  "Do you
remember the spot?"
</p>

<p>
She looked at him and nodded, and her
look sent a little flame of happiness dancing
into his brown eyes.  He swung out of the
saddle, and she slipped down into his arms,
the movement loosing her red-gold hair
until it flooded down about his hands.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Kitty&mdash;Kitty!"
</p>

<p>
He looked into her eyes and could say no
more for a moment.  So they stood together,
gazing each at the other, while the two horses
moved away and began to crop the grass,
unheeded.
</p>

<p>
Then Norton drew away from her, freed
his hands, and soberly unclasped a golden
eagle from his coat.  He looked at it, then
held it to her.
</p>

<p>
"Kitty&mdash;sweet Kitty&mdash;I brought you here
away from your father and our friends, here
where we first met&mdash;there is something I
must tell you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He faltered, and with a quick laugh she
flung back her hair.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Norton"&mdash;and there was mimicry
in her voice&mdash;"I&mdash;I too have something
to tell you!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes?" he said gravely, stiffening a
little.  "Yes?"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, but I would not take precedence of
a soldier, sir!"
</p>

<p>
And she made him a laughing curtsy,
perhaps to hide the great glory of womanhood
that shone in her face.
</p>

<p>
"Then, my news is this," said Norton,
lifting a tress of her hair to his lips.  "A
regiment of riflemen from Kentucky has been
formed; trouble is brewing with England;
There is trouble on the frontier.  I have been
offered the command of this regiment, Kitty.
I ask you&mdash;will you take this emblem of all
that is dearest to me, and take with it the
heart of John Norton?  A soldier's life and
pay is not much to share&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Soldiers do not serve for pay," she said
very steadily, and put her hand upon his,
clutching the golden eagle of the Cincinnati
between them.  "Nor do women serve that
they may share&mdash;oh, my dear!  You have
not yet told me the dearest thing of all&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
And so they told each other.
</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
